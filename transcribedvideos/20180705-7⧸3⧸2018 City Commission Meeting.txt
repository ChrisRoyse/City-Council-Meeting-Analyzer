End: 00:21:08.420
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: The rezoning that occurred at that time left it as I-5 but it didn't take an account the area that was being proposed. And so without addressing it either through variants with the border zoning appeals or through this PUD process, it would be unbuildable and the plat could not go through based on our subdivision regulations.

Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: The city and the developer or the property owner chose the PUD route in that the variant standards are pretty tough. One of the hardest ones to overcome is what is the hardship that is not created or excuse me the unique condition that's not created by the owner as well as the hardship and being that the property owner is creating the plat, it's tough to overcome those factors.
