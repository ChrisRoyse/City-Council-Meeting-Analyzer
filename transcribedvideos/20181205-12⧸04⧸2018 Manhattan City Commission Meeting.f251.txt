End: 00:13:51.000

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:14:14.000
End: 00:14:42.000
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: That was the most probably significant improvements that were made with some accessibility improvements that are kind of worn out with a lift and so that's kind of the process that would come back to you all to determine whether or not there's a specific proposal or you want to, you know, the committee itself will weigh the proposals and might have a further process to analyze if there's numerous ones.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morse:
Start: 00:14:42.000

End: 00:15:16.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: If we if the other commissioners would agree I think if we pass this tonight it would be applicable for us to make kind of a suggestion and promise to community that this will go through the historic resources board and the purpose record board before it comes to the commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morse:
Start: 00:15:16.000
End: 00:15:26.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morse:
Start: 00:16:11.000
End: 00:16:28.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Probably going to generate a lot of questions questions that really the commission need to weigh and give input and feedback on so it may be a process where you do hear the proposals we get your feedback if you do want us to go to park and make advisory board historic resources board.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morse:
Start: 00:16:28.000
End: 00:16:41.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:02:24.600

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:03:06.600
End: 01:03:18.600
Duration: 12.000 seconds

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:03:18.600
End: 01:03:31.600
Duration: 13.000 seconds

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:03:31.600
End: 01:03:39.600
Duration: 8.000 seconds

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:03:50.600

Duration: 13.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:04:03.600
End: 01:04:25.600
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: And that would be Laramie from north Manhattan to 11th. And then the section of Laramie that is to the south of the garage location from 14th to north Manhattan would have a center turn lane so that you could stack and get in and out of the garage.

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:04:25.600

Start: 01:04:57.600
End: 01:05:07.600
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:05:07.600
End: 01:05:27.600
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: You're putting resources into the having street trees, but you're not saying we're going to spread this out over everything. We're going to put the dollars and the resources where, you know, it's going to get the most bang for the buck and where the focus needs to be in these areas that have lighter traffic loads less people walking through them and their pass through.

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:05:27.600
End: 01:05:42.600
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: They're not sort of let's stop and pause and linger. You would spend less resources. And so as we as we move to the parameters and we have our landscapes on our street trees and our sidewalks, you start to see what that means.

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:05:42.600

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 01:06:23.600
End: 01:06:41.600
Duration: 18.000 seconds

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:10:46.600

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:11:26.600

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:11:33.600
