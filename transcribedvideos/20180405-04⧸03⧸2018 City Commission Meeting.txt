Although my guess is that they're not going through this endeavor to use a lower use or lower development than what is potential with the C3. So I think it will be okay.

Text: Does that seem reasonable I think one of the things to remember is if if we do draft a policy that kind of when we run at these time issues is usually because we have very long public comment so if we have more limited public comment more targeted public comment I think the meetings will run more efficient smoother and these time frames won't be because the 10 30 is obviously three and a half hours after we start here 7 30 is two hours on work sessions.
