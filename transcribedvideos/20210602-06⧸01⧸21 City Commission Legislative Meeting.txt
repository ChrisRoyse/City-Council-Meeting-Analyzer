--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:05:24.680
End: 00:05:35.680

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:05:35.680

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:05:56.680
End: 00:06:06.680

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:

End: 00:06:19.680

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:06:19.680
End: 00:06:31.680
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So, we issued $50 million in Starbonds in 2009. That primarily was for the construction of the Discovery Center, acquiring land, building half of the parking garage, the Blueworth Park, and some south infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:06:31.680
End: 00:06:48.680
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Those bonds will be paid off this year. If you recall, back in 2018, we actually approached you with a different Starbond proposal, off-Cimble Avenue, to construct a museum and a Jocency to K-State Athletics, K-State Foundation.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:06:48.680
End: 00:06:58.680
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: It was in reference to the Bill Snyder-type museum. You all did approve that. We expanded the district, and we looked at that concept.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:06:58.680
End: 00:07:07.680
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: We obviously didn't move forward with that project. The Secretary of Commerce ended up not supporting that fully. So, it ended up coming off the table.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:07:07.680
End: 00:07:12.680
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: But it would have done essentially the same thing. The life of the district runs through 2026.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:07:12.680
End: 00:07:33.680
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: So, we can capture revenues through the end of 26, even into the first couple months at 27 before it expires. So, there's always been this potential for five, five and a half years of revenue that could somehow be held within our community and spent and dedicated towards a qualifying project.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:07:34.680
End: 00:07:40.680
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Starbonds are supported by state sales tax generated from both the North End and the South End.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:07:40.680
End: 00:07:49.680
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: State sales tax. That's 6.5% that the state collects from all the businesses on the North and South.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:07:49.680
End: 00:07:58.680
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: We dedicate our local sales tax, our 1% and our portion of the county sales tax, just on the South Area.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:07:59.680
End: 00:08:08.680
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Our Northern sales tax go towards our tiff bonds. The Southern sales for the local only stay within that district for Starbonds.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:08:08.680
End: 00:08:18.680
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: The state also required us to put in 90 grand a year in transit gas tax. That was when we added the two hotels instead of a mixed use type of development.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:08:18.680
End: 00:08:25.680
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: They required we put in the revenue to the equivalent of the 90 grand.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:08:25.680
End: 00:08:34.680
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So, since 06, that annual revenue generated for Starbonds has ranged anywhere from 5 million a year to 6 million a year.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:08:34.680
End: 00:08:45.680
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Our portion, that local portion on the South End has averaged just over 106,820 dollars since 09.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:08:45.680
End: 00:08:50.680
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: It's fluctuated every year. That transient gas tax and another 90K.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:08:50.680
End: 00:09:00.680
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So, we're looking at just about $200,000 a year that comes from city revenues, pledge-stored Starbonds for the next 5 and a half, 6 years.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:00.680
End: 00:09:14.680
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: The city backed those bonds in 09 with a moral obligation, meaning if revenues didn't materialize and the principal interest is due, the city would have had to come up with those revenues at any time between 09 and 09.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:14.680
End: 00:09:21.680
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And 2021. Fortunately, we never had to do that.

Text: Future Starbonds, we anticipate issuing if this project moves forward.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:28.680
End: 00:09:41.680
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: We do not anticipate a moral obligation on these bonds. That would expire with the existing and we're looking at issuing something down the road that would not have that moral law.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:41.680
End: 00:09:55.680
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: That anticipation of that $200,000 dedicated through end of 26, beginning of 27 would be expected of the city along with the state's portion as well.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:55.680
End: 00:10:02.680
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: We anticipate that issuance could take place in the next 920 days if things moved along.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:10:02.680
End: 00:10:05.680
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:10:05.680
End: 00:10:08.680
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So, we're looking at the state's portion of the city.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:10:08.680
End: 00:10:11.680
Duration: 3.000 seconds
