--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McClellan:
Start: 02:26:46.920
End: 02:26:55.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And it's a lot easier to say no to that than do you want a pool that we're going to engage and make sure and spend as much time as we want to.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McClellan:
Start: 02:26:55.920

City Manager:

End: 02:42:19.920
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: But it's clear that there's just a lot of different things we need to be doing. And as I've said, I'm not sure you're all tired of hearing me say this, but I really think we have to have a discussion and ask the public where our focus for parks and rec should be.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:42:19.920

City Manager:

Text: Now, there's obviously a big indoor water component to this. And the reason that's the primary is because we did ask the people what they wanted to see.

Commissioner McClellan:
Start: 02:44:11.920

Commissioner McClellan:
Start: 02:46:15.920
End: 02:46:27.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Yeah. So my anticipated goal would be between 35 and 40% as a cost recovery goal. And that would be the top of line. Now we've got to work to that. We were 22% last year.

Commissioner McClellan:
Start: 02:46:27.920

Text: So as four, you can continue to operate as four for 18 months if that's what you chose to do. If you want an appointment, that's a process you can identify.

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:57:43.920

Text: How long will, and this may just be something that we work out, how long will Susan's term as mayor be? Will it be the rest of Wins term and then the term she was supposed to have?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:58:12.920
End: 02:58:21.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, she's filling the unexpired term, which would run through the end of the year. And we would be the same on the law board as well, filling that unexpired term.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McClellan:
Start: 02:58:21.920
End: 02:58:26.920
Duration: 5.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:58:26.920
End: 02:58:37.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:58:37.920
End: 02:58:51.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And we kicked around one scenario where Susan finishes the year, Karen takes the next year, and then they repeat Susan and Karen again, that would actually put us back on track.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:58:51.920
End: 02:58:57.920
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McClellan:
Start: 02:58:57.920
End: 02:59:04.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:59:04.920
End: 02:59:12.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:59:12.920
End: 02:59:21.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: I think Susan has done a great job. She has handled her first meeting just beautifully, but it is, it's a challenge. She's been in a lot. We've talked a lot.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:59:21.920
End: 02:59:30.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:59:30.920

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:59:41.920
End: 02:59:55.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds

Text: Can I make a suggestion that we tackle these the two, the two other parts of this item to make a motion to appoint one of the commissioners as mayor pro-tem and to make a motion to appoint someone to complete wins term and then open up for a discussion about process.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:

Speaker_1:
Start: 03:00:43.920

Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 03:00:50.920
End: 03:00:58.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And that typically would have some public comment. So if you're going to identify the mayor pro-tem and you're going to identify the law board replacement.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 03:00:58.920
End: 03:01:06.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Those are typically on consent agenda. The mayor pro-tem process is is strange because it really it's on the agenda that you don't get public comment on it.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 03:01:06.920
End: 03:01:14.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: It's just a unique item traditionally. It's the night the mayor takes seat. It's a vote that happens. It's not like the public has a lot of comment on it.

Speaker_1:
Start: 03:01:14.920
