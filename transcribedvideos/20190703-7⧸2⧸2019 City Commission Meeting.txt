I've got a couple of cats that get terrified when people launch that stuff over my house so remember that the animals are not really in favor of all that banging especially if it goes on all night and then my final point because I like what Parks and Rec does with the animal shelter doing some great work there.

Text: So I'm doing things you know make sure there's enough shade enough hydration for everybody because people get sick believe it or not still in the sunshine in Kansas and on the fireworks I think we've been pretty clear about fireworks we want people to have fun and enjoy the fourth but if you would just remember a couple things like either have a hose or a bucket of water so that when you get done with the fireworks don't dump them in the garbage dump them in that bucket of water and then you get them to the fire.

Commissioner:
Start: 00:28:17.800
End: 00:28:29.800

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:43:41.800
End: 00:43:51.800

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:43:52.800

End: 00:44:57.800

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:44:57.800
End: 00:45:14.800
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, probably the difference is, is that at the time of the 2018 bond election, that the school district had identified that the ability to accommodate, I think, 20 plus parking spaces on site, which would be replacing the mobile unit, which is on the property, and probably also relocating the playground.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:45:14.800
End: 00:45:28.800
Duration: 14.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:45:28.800
End: 00:45:41.800
Duration: 13.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:45:41.800

Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 01:48:29.800

Start: 02:16:53.800
End: 02:17:04.800

Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:17:04.800
End: 02:17:17.800

Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:18:08.800
End: 02:18:25.800
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: But this is a working conditions issue. One thing I would highly suggest. I am going to be supporting the proposal presented by staff. But with that proposal, if I have any control, I would like to definitely have a designated spot for the traveling teachers.

Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:18:25.800
End: 02:18:33.800

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:18:33.800
End: 02:18:47.800
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Because you probably have the time down to like 10 minutes or 15 minutes as far as travel time. But if that can be done, I think that would create one less stress because there's a lot of other stresses you can't control. But that is one less thing you have to think about.

Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:19:19.800
End: 02:19:30.800
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:19:30.800
End: 02:19:38.800
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: It won't just be a concrete place, an empty spot. And I think the idea of having a marker of the historic relevance to that area is also critical.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:19:38.800
End: 02:19:48.800
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So it does give some not only community environment, but ownership for the children that are in that school area also learning along the way.

Mayor Michael L. Dodson:
Start: 02:19:48.800

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:20:22.800

Text: And so knowing that someday will happen, we've actually planned for an 8 foot wide sidewalk instead of a standard 5 foot sidewalk to come south down to the school to give that, you know, basically provide a little bit more room because we know that there's plan to be in already are some subdivisions to the north.
