Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:29:34.160
End: 00:29:48.160
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: One of the recommendations out of that was licensing massage therapy, establishments and massage therapist in cities. Kansas is one of only two states that doesn't license massage therapist at the state level.

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:29:48.160
End: 00:30:12.160
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: And the absence of that license and inspection can lead to some illicit activity in certain communities as we mentioned human sex trafficking sexual assault and other illicit activities are Riley County attorney Barry Wilkerson, he also urged the commission through a letter requesting that an ordinance in Manhattan be passed.

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:30:12.160

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:30:33.160

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:30:41.160
End: 00:30:47.160

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:31:10.160
End: 00:31:31.160
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: So we brought that feedback from that public meeting to a work session in October and we really we really asked a few specific questions. One, do you want to consider an ordinance here in the future to adopt and then we also went into some specifics as in regards to where massage therapy can be practiced.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:31:32.160
End: 00:31:59.160
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: You know, we went into detail about daily registers, hotel rooms, in-home establishments. So over the course of the winter and into the spring, we met again internally with city staff, city attorney's office, our code services division staff, customer service staff as well as our CPD to really draft an ordinance that we could present to practitioners for their feedback and we did that in March.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:31:59.160
End: 00:32:10.160
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:32:11.160
End: 00:32:27.160
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: Just to give you a little breakdown of the ordinance structure, those first couple pages, we go into some definitions. I'm not going to go over those in detail and specific, but if you have a question about a definition as it comes up throughout the PowerPoint, please let me know.

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:32:27.160
End: 00:32:56.160
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: We go into exceptions. So these are basically establishments or individuals who would be exempt from this ordinance. It lists in detail quite a few day care providers, medical facilities, people licensed under a different profession in the board of healing arts at the state level, as well as those practicing, you know, parboring or cosmology as licensed under the state board of cosmology.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:32:57.160
End: 00:33:18.160
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: Then it breaks down into really two separate licenses. So we're licensing two different things here, we're licensing massage therapy establishments, which is kind of the brick and mortar business where that practice can occur. It goes into the application process, how it's issued operational regulations, as well as inspection.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:33:18.160
End: 00:33:42.160
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: And we'll go into detail with that later this evening. And then we also separately licensed massage therapists. So that's the individual person who is practicing massage therapy in the community. And it goes through a similar application and issuance process. There's also educational requirements that a therapist would have to meet in order to practice, as well as renew their license and there is similar operational regulations.

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:33:42.160
End: 00:34:03.160
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: We have the effective date in there as August 1st, if this passes first and second reading. And really that is going to give city administration one time to just develop the applications and then communicate and educate the public to get those forms out in front of them so that they can be licensed by August 1st.

Text: This ordinance essentially allows it in all those areas we discussed back in October. So the massage therapy establishment itself, which is the brick and mortar facility off site massage therapy, which is essentially any business or residential premise where the patron is asking for massage therapy services.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:34:32.160
End: 00:34:43.160
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: That would include hotel rooms. We did note back in October that there were a couple of cities across Kansas who didn't allow massage therapy to occur in hotel rooms.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:34:43.160
End: 00:35:00.160
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: When we had our public meetings and then additional meetings just with individuals in the community, they noted that it's a very common practice to go to hotel rooms, whether you have a traveling athletes or traveling individual visiting our community and they need massage therapy services.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:35:00.160
End: 00:35:10.160

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:35:10.160
End: 00:35:25.160
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: There is some concern from other cities and when they address this in their ordinance of whether or not to allow, you know, if I was a massage therapist having it in my residential home, being my practice, kind of like a home occupation.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:35:25.160
End: 00:35:49.160
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: So we do in fact allow that if you meet applicable code and zoning. That was kind of a debate. We talked about grandfathering in, but we also just kind of in our public meetings, we realized the benefit to allowing massage therapists to continue to practice in the community, even if they are no longer working in a massage therapy establishment.

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:35:49.160

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:36:27.160
End: 00:36:37.160
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And that's going to be a separate from the $200 fee because we contract our customer service when they process these applications. We contract with the third party to run our background checks.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:36:37.160
End: 00:36:45.160

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:36:45.160
End: 00:37:09.160
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: The fee is there to cover staff time from customer service to process the application. They need to go into verification of the driver's license, checking all the information that's on the application as well as there's a requirement that we'll discuss later that upon issuance before issuance of a license you need to be inspected by a code official.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:37:09.160
End: 00:37:23.160

Mayor Michael Dodson:
Start: 00:37:45.160
End: 00:38:02.160
Duration: 17.000 seconds

Commissioner Aaron Estabrook:
Start: 00:39:38.160
End: 00:40:04.160
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: Because there's a couple in there that I don't like adultery. That's against the law. Like I really if a spouse cheats on another spouse, I'm not sure that that's something we're overly concerned about when licensing a massage therapist. Obviously a lot of the other things on that list are important, but is not even against the law.
