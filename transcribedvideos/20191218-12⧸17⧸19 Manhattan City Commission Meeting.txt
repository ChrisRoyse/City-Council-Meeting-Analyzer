Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:28:16.180
End: 04:28:28.180

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:28:28.180

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:28:36.180
End: 04:28:48.180

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:39:27.180

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:39:40.180
End: 04:39:52.180

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:39:52.180

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:40:10.180
End: 04:40:24.180

Start: 04:40:24.180

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:40:36.180
End: 04:40:53.180

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 04:40:53.180
