Text: Between that meeting right at the end of or beginning of summer, right before summer started and our subsequent second meeting, which was after summer was over, we also met with city staff and USD 383 staff and others within the city organization, Parks of Rec, to get some feedback on more generic items.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:21:41.680
End: 01:21:52.680
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Heating and cooling systems, alarm systems, controls, those types of things. And so all of those things were gathered during the summer months when we weren't meeting with the steering committee.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:21:52.680
End: 01:22:10.680
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So then, next slide please. So then when we came back to the steering committee after summer was over in the fall of 2018, we had put together a list of options based on that feedback we had gotten from the first one.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:22:10.680
End: 01:22:39.680
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: And you see those seven options up here and we had price tags associated with each one of those. And we talked through each one of those items at that meeting in as much detail as we could so that after that meeting, we could then administer an online survey to the steering committee about their rank for each one of these items.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:22:39.680
End: 01:22:55.680
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And we did explain there's a couple of things on here specifically the running track. You can't have all three of those options in the facility and we explained that to them. Each one had its own price tag.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:22:55.680
End: 01:23:10.680
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: We explained to them that a elevated running track short or long carried with it the necessity to put in an elevator to access that level as well as stairs to get up to that level.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:23:10.680
End: 01:23:21.680
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: The benefits of that also allowed for some additional spectator seating up on that level and some multipurpose space up on that level. And so we kind of topped through all of that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:23:21.680
End: 01:23:28.680
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: The other ones are a little bit more cut and dry and that if you choose this, you don't x that out.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:23:28.680
End: 01:23:45.680
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So we went back and this I think was the order that they put them in they weren't necessarily presented in this order but that was the order from the online survey that they fell out of the results from.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:23:45.680
End: 01:23:59.680
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So after that we went back and we had been up to that point just showing some very, very conceptual rectangular shaped floor plans and how spaces could be arranged within that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:23:59.680
End: 01:24:11.680
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We then went back with that added layer of information and scope of work to then start to fine tune these on building envelopes and the footprints.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:24:11.680
End: 01:24:40.680
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: And ultimately the subsequent steering committee meetings after that were us coming back to them with hey here's an idea or two or three not only just from an interior court layout but even exterior aesthetics of what the buildings could look like receiving back feedback from doing some imagery sessions with the steering committee to get a sense of what should be done.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:24:40.680
End: 01:24:56.680
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So that was all put together and ultimately at the end of that this list here is what the facilities are today conceptually and we've got some images that will show you after this slide.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:24:56.680
End: 01:25:20.680
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: But each facility is 48,900 square feet. Each facility has the ability and I need to clarify on this to have four basketball courts, five volleyball courts, 12 pickable courts, not all at the same time.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:25:20.680
End: 01:25:31.680
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: There are various arrangements of that and anything in between if you're using four basketball courts you're using all of the gym floor space.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:25:31.680
End: 01:25:42.680
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: If you're using two basketball courts you very well might have three volleyball courts going and if you're using six pickable courts you could have a basketball and a volleyball going.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:25:42.680
End: 01:26:01.680
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: There's an empty number of arrangements that that could take on. We also included the portable turf which allows us to have soccer, footsaw, golf, baseball and probably a handful of other options when that turf is down.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:26:01.680
End: 01:26:21.680
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: And the turf right now is that if you envision the floor plans you have two gyms on this side of a core area and two courts on this side of a core area we have enough turf at each facility to cover two courts of area not be entire area.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:26:21.680
End: 01:26:34.680
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And with having turf one of the things we had to explain to the steering committee was if you choose turf there's a certain amount of storage that comes along with that turf because it's not down year round.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:26:34.680
End: 01:26:49.680
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so that was factored into not only the pricing but also the design. The elevated running track made it in there the lobby and mezzanine with lounge and spectating seating, community rooms and concessions.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:26:49.680
End: 01:27:09.680
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: And the raising of the track really offered us and afforded us a lot of opportunity to capture space that was already within the footprint of the building and then allowed us to include some of these others without expanding the footprint of the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:27:09.680
End: 01:27:15.680
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So it's really a cost effective way to gather space or to capture space.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:27:15.680
End: 01:27:38.680
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: The community room space and you'll see this in the floor plan it's one large room that can be subdivided into two spaces and then the concessions area and there's a lot of discussion that happened around that not only with the steering committee but with a neighborhood group that was president almost every session we had is what we had.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:27:38.680
End: 01:27:45.680
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And I'm sure you'll hear some more about that and I'll talk about that when we get to the floor plans.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:27:45.680
End: 01:27:57.680
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: But we made some modifications on that to help facilitate future finish out of that space to make hopefully the facility better in the long run.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:27:57.680
End: 01:28:03.680
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So I think with that well I should ask do you have any questions on any of that up to this point.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:28:03.680
End: 01:28:12.680
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Yeah the only one that confused me when I was reading through it's maybe not a confusion but can you explain more of the thinking behind why turf is necessary.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:28:12.680
End: 01:28:26.680
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Like when I think about the facilities that we have in Manhattan obviously we've put money into baseball facilities we have pretty robust golf facility so why was turf a priority to use that money in that way rather than somewhere else.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:28:27.680
End: 01:28:54.680
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: And I may allow some of the steering committee members who are present to address that question as well when you open it up to public comment but what we heard was just the ability to have soccer practice year round when outdoor practices get rained out or in the winter when they're wanting to continue to hone in on their skills.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:28:54.680
End: 01:29:08.840
Duration: 14.160 seconds
Text: And baseball and I would probably tell you baseball and soccer were the two primary concerns but once you put turf in you have other options that open up to you as well so you can have bad
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:29:08.840
End: 01:29:18.840
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: and bad end cages that come down so that you have baseball practice year round and if you think about this we have two identical facilities.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:29:18.840
End: 01:29:37.840
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: The flexibility that will have based on each one having the same thing just you won't necessarily and this will be partly operational to decision making but you could have turf just down at one.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:29:37.840
End: 01:29:59.840
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: And so we wanted one for say three months and still have one facility that's all court space of some configuration and still half of that facility and so just the flexibility and what you can offer on a year round basis I think was one of the driving factors for having turf in these facilities.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:29:59.840
End: 01:30:04.840
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: It's okay if you don't know this off the top of your head but how big of a budget line item is that turf.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:30:04.840
End: 01:30:16.840
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: I believe it was about 250,000 for both facilities. Any other questions on the other information to this point.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:30:16.840
End: 01:30:33.840
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: I do want to point out that that was one of the additional add-on features that the steering committee did choose so we'll cover this a little bit further in the slide when we get to the budget perspective but the general consensus was to start with the
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:30:33.840
End: 01:30:56.840
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: minimum requirements so the facilities had a baseline expectation of a certain number of certain programs to be involved in it and that was the starting point and then these add-on features were allowed, gave the steering committee the ability to pick and choose what based on a priority that the steering committee had for different activities.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:30:56.840
End: 01:31:09.840
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Barry will hit on that a little later there's the baseline of the building's cost X and so we figured that out and we protected that bucket of money.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:31:09.840
End: 01:31:24.840
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: We also figured out what the site costs were between both facilities and they're not the same but we figured out what that cost was and protected that and that left us this bucket of money to kind of have some fun with.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:31:24.840
End: 01:31:34.840
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And that's really the bucket of money that the steering committee gave us direction on and where these priorities fell out at.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:31:34.840
End: 01:31:48.840
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So this is an overview of the Eisenhower site and what you can see here is this is Walter's Drive right here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:31:48.840
End: 01:32:08.840
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: This is the existing school in this configuration. This little piece and this piece here are the future additions more than likely they won't be that shape but they will be in this general location and then this is the new rec center here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:32:08.840
End: 01:32:30.840
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: You may recall that maybe last year or the year before you saw this facility primarily placed over here in this as we started this process it was brought to our attention that the city was looking at extending Kirkwood through the west edge of this site.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:32:30.840
End: 01:32:59.840
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I think because of partly annexing this area for future development where Walter's Morgan construction is and some storage units that if that were to happen the steering committee agreed that this then would be the ideal location versus over here where really the only opportunity to access it would have been to come back.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:32:59.840
End: 01:33:18.840
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So it would have been to come in through the school's parking lot and into some sort of parking configuration whether the building was long ways this way or this way there would have had to be an additional parking and the facility would have kind of been hidden behind the school.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:33:18.840
End: 01:33:47.840
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So that moving on it became clear that this Kirkwood extension was probably going to be a reality and so that just further cemented the idea that this location would be best and there's probably several reasons you know that this Kirkwood extension might be a good idea and that is it allows buses to pick up children come out here go out tomorrow that avenue and get to a lighted intersection.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:33:48.840
End: 01:34:17.840
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So this is a very important section versus the intersection of Walters and TCB which has some safety issues and I know Rob odd and those have talked to you about that in the past but this also allowed the building to present itself to the public from what will you know TC I can't go off screen sorry Marlett and TCB is right over here and so a lighted intersection getting people to this this building front that intersection.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:34:18.840
End: 01:34:34.840
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So it will have a good public presence as people want to come to this facility or even for say a tournament weekend people trying to find the facility it presents itself to the public well in this orientation parking will be somewhere out front.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:34:35.840
End: 01:34:58.840
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: We know we've got a little bit of a grading issue to be dealt with here the plan is that the building will be at the same elevation as the school building which is out of the floodplain and the parking I think there's a little bit of site work that has to be accomplished there to accommodate that as well that this is the orientation of the Eisenhower building.

Lyle Butler:

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:35:04.840
End: 01:35:07.840
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: I believe it was about 200.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:35:07.840
End: 01:35:24.840
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: That was something we and I'll be honest originally when we were planning we had more than what was needed early on and then once we talked with city staff we were able to hone in on the number that was actually required by the regulations or desired.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:35:24.840
End: 01:35:39.840
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So this now is the well sorry I should pause for a second any questions on the other questions on the Eisenhower site.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:35:39.840
End: 01:36:08.840
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: This now is the Anthony site. So you have Brown Avenue, Beconwood and again if you go back maybe a year and a half to two years you were probably recalling that the building was located up here in this location which I think was a logical solution at the time the only issue that really had was this dirt here is about six seven eight feet higher than the other.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:36:08.840
End: 01:36:31.840
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So it was about eight feet higher than the floor of the building and the connecting link that would have had to get to that would have presented some challenges not only from a great standpoint but also just accessibility to the football field the track from where people would park for games and events at this destination right here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:36:31.840
End: 01:37:00.840
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So we we now and we sort of assess the site is it even feasible to move the building to the south side of Anthony and we determined that it was and that we could then get a similar engagement to the building from whatever future addition happens here at the middle school directly into the building and have essentially a similar case of both Eisenhower and Anthony even though they might enter in a slightly different spot.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:37:00.840
End: 01:37:25.840
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: Again the building sets on there fairly well the building will be at the same elevation finish floor elevation is the school and then the thought was this building presents itself much better to browning as a busier street than Beconwood which is really more of a residential street heading into this residential neighborhood back here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:37:25.840
End: 01:37:51.840
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: Again parking out front same number of parking stalls the main issue on this site was that this general area is currently used as detention when the school was originally built and so we will be reworking some of that detention and either working it around the edge of the parking and or even creating a small detention area back here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:37:51.840
End: 01:38:04.840
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: That's for our engineers to figure out once we move into the next concept but her next stage of the services but that has been vetted out that we can accommodate that and approved by city staff.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:38:04.840
End: 01:38:11.840
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So any questions on the Anthony site.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:38:11.840
End: 01:38:40.840
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So these are the basic floor plans you see the first floor on the top and I'll tell you from the very beginning not only was the cities one of the city's main concerns and one of the school district's main concerns but also the steering committees main concerns was security between the school and the public during school hours when the school was completed.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:38:40.840
End: 01:39:04.840
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: So we were able to do school hours when students may be using part of this facility and one of the very first concepts we delivered was to take all of this ancillary space from off the front of the building and push it inside and separate the building into two parts putting two courts on one side and two courts on the other.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:39:04.840
End: 01:39:16.840
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So that allowed us to in this particular plan this would be the school side right here so there'd be a connection to the school somewhere over in this corner.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:39:16.840
End: 01:39:31.840
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: But that allows this to be completely a solid wall you know a door with some glass in it possibly for for visibility but this would be completely solid and secure during the school hours.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:39:31.840
End: 01:39:41.840
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So we were able to allow people to enter the building and use this gymnasium and the track above on this side and that was also one of the reasons the steering committee chose the short track.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:39:41.840
End: 01:40:00.840
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: If we would have chosen the long track it would have gone over this and we would have had to figure out some way to secure that during the day whether we block it off roughly in here and have a cut through which would just be more track to build on top of the long track and additional expense.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:40:00.840
End: 01:40:11.840
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So a good compromise was the short track option which you can see above right here that goes around in again this is solid wall so there's no visibility into the school side.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:40:11.840
End: 01:40:25.840
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So the security the primary secure issues were resolved in that manner there'll be some technology that goes into that as well on doors and things like that but that was the main design challenge there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:40:25.840
End: 01:40:50.840
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: Again as you enter you'll enter a lobby a small vestibule here you have some public space seating area out here you immediately enter and hit the control desk which is a low desk where it'll be staffed and then you have some a couple of offices and storage space in this general area with stand up workstations here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:40:50.840
End: 01:41:10.840
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: And again that's all open to this front entry so there's no visible barrier there and that was in part a request by Parks and Rec Department that we want the more eyes we have of people who are programming things here out towards the entry the better.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:41:10.840
End: 01:41:24.840
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: There is also a small storage space in here for whatever items they might need to store in there from an office standpoint and a small works space where they'd have their copy or printer and things like that.

Text: You can see the elevator right here that goes up to the second floor and also when you enter the stairs that go up to that mezzanine level or right here to the my left but as you enter it would be to your right.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 01:41:39.840
End: 01:41:57.840
Duration: 18.000 seconds

Start: 01:41:57.840
End: 01:42:20.840
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: On the backside of that stair and it's hard to see here but this section of wall right here and all of these circles which are really little chairs that is seating for people to be able to sit and look through a wall a glass wall partition and watch activities over there.

Start: 01:42:31.840
End: 01:42:43.840

City Manager:
Start: 01:51:21.800

Speaker_4:
Start: 01:53:27.800
End: 01:53:50.800
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So the idea of cooking equipment was budgeted within the facility and once we heard the feedback and their desires we went back and looked at this is there a way for us to accommodate the future ability to put some equipment in even if it can't make it in as a part of the initial project.

Start: 01:53:58.800
End: 01:54:14.800
Duration: 16.000 seconds

Speaker_4:
Start: 01:54:14.800
End: 01:54:41.800
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: So we reconfigured it and we showed a potential option that doesn't mean it's going to be this because we're showing a stove refrigerator and all that stuff in there right now that we've made it pretty clear that the equipment isn't in it but that community group has expressed the desire to potentially get grants to furnish it with equipment.

Speaker_4:
Start: 01:54:41.800
End: 01:54:58.800
Duration: 17.000 seconds

Start: 02:40:48.800
End: 02:40:57.800
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So at this at this end, you see overall in talking with the university and we're talking with the city. We came in and we reduced the canopy by about 25%.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:40:57.800
End: 02:41:08.800
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: That's for biggest consumers long going maintenance and the year should back in the city and the city and the university keep up on those trees. So with that, we also so long this portion, you see there's the consistent low landscape wall.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:41:08.800
End: 02:41:18.800
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And that would be against the athletic facilities there. And then we have the portions of the landscape beds that are roughly eight foot by 60 foot within those areas through here.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:41:18.800
End: 02:41:28.800
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We have the trees placed on their staggered 50 foot center. So on each side of the sidewalk. So I think that even with the reduction, we'll still get as a nice tree canopy as those trees mature.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:41:28.800
End: 02:41:40.800
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So that's been the biggest change on this portion. Our next slide is as we look at the South South into college. This is down by soccer and baseball with the existing fence.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:41:40.800
End: 02:41:57.800
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: What we've done here is we have kind of consolidated the trees you see here. So we're there local there in pairs of twos a little closer together. They're about about a hundred feet apart. This gives the ability to still have some tree cover, but it doesn't disturb you disrupt the view into the athletic facilities, which was one of the concerns from the university.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:41:57.800
End: 02:42:01.800

Start: 02:42:01.800
End: 02:42:11.800
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Now as we move to the next, this is this is Kimbell. So we're on where at Kimbell Avenue, as you can see through here, overall we've got a reduction of 25% tree canopy.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:42:11.800
End: 02:42:19.800
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: This is the South side of Kimbell. And you will see along the athletics portions, we've got that consistent stone wall, much reminiscent of the existing campus.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:42:19.800
End: 02:42:30.800
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Then we've got just some areas of landscape behind them to give a little green relief with that. And then as we come down those trees are staggered on this side, we do have a few median trees where we do have a median along Kimbell proposed.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:42:30.800
End: 02:42:39.800
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And then as we jump to the north side of Kimbell, you'll see again, we're getting those pairs of trees. But on this side, we've actually cut down on the amount of stone wall in working with foundations.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:42:39.800
End: 02:42:45.800
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So we have basically we have a 60 foot opening without the stone wall. Then we have a 40 foot section. And that's consistent along.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:42:45.800
End: 02:42:57.800
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So it gives us, it gives us enough of that element along the north side. So as you're driving down Kimbell, you get the idea that you've entered the university environment and the, and the North Campus corridor.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:42:57.800
End: 02:43:05.800

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:43:17.800

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:43:28.800
End: 02:43:39.800

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:43:39.800
End: 02:43:54.800
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So one time we had that entire median planted. The university is really pushing to have a mode of edge to that. Much, much easier to maintain that. So we still get, I think that character that we're striving for throughout the project, but something is a little, a little more reasonable maintenance wise.

Text: If you know, there's quite a bit of grade coming coming up or down the hill whichever way you're going. So we've got sections of walls. So those sections of walls are going to be anywhere from about 30 to 40 feet, but they're going to step down the hill as it comes down. So we still get that, that element, that edge of campus that we're trying to identify, but we're not, you know, putting a whole wall down that size as you can kind of see.

So it's really, it's just about every utility we can have in a very narrow right away is happening here. But you can see what that does aesthetically for that. And not only that, but you know, we've all seen, I think Jeremy's gun touch on this. We've all seen around around campus around the city when utilities companies come in and address the tree canopy around the power lines. And it can be some, if we're going to spend this money on trying to develop this tree canopy.
