Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:21:44.360

Start: 00:21:57.360
End: 00:22:09.360
Duration: 12.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:22:09.360
End: 00:22:20.360

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:22:53.360
End: 00:23:06.360
Duration: 13.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:23:06.360

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Wynn Butler:

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:23:25.360
End: 00:23:34.360
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: It would be it would be allowed under the zoning district so just like our wastewater treatment plant we could rezone it to be it would be PI 2.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:23:34.360
End: 00:23:49.360
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: But I would imagine the reason that it's restricted to the taxing entities is because we we hold them to a higher standard of would they go in and you know would we as a city go in and locate our wastewater treatment plant here in the middle of residential areas.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:23:49.360
End: 00:23:59.360
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: The answer would be no. So part of that is just that that consideration every decision we make has to be in an open forum as does the school district and the county.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mc:
Start: 00:23:59.360
End: 00:24:08.360
