Speaker_4:
Start: 02:32:02.460
End: 02:32:15.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:32:15.460
End: 02:32:30.460

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:32:30.460
End: 02:32:44.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:33:48.460
End: 02:33:56.460
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: One thing we put in there is oftentimes there could be an instance where you have a board that no one is applying to be on that board.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:33:56.460
End: 02:34:04.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:34:04.460
End: 02:34:15.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:34:15.460
End: 02:34:25.460

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:34:25.460

End: 02:34:49.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:34:49.460
End: 02:35:05.460
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: It has to be from a person who has applied for the city commission to consider and we threw that in there just because we need to make sure that these appointments are being made in a timely fashion.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:35:05.460
End: 02:35:18.460
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Much like it is today, the commission can reject a nomination for an appointment or the city commission can also provide a recommendation of someone within that candidate pool.

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:35:18.460
End: 02:35:24.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:35:24.460
End: 02:35:38.460
Duration: 14.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:35:38.460
End: 02:35:53.460
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And that's for various reasons. One of the main being we don't know if that individual is still interested who's the next recommendation they haven't been provided any notice of that and the public hasn't been provided any notice that that individual is being selected.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:35:53.460
End: 02:36:00.460

Start: 02:36:00.460
End: 02:36:14.460
Duration: 14.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:36:14.460
End: 02:36:27.460
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Right now we have bylaws that have been drafted 20 years ago, five years ago, ten years ago, some say that they don't even mention minutes at all or even posting an agenda or what the quorum is believe it or not.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:36:27.460
End: 02:36:32.460

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:36:32.460
End: 02:36:42.460
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:36:42.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:36:46.460
End: 02:36:56.460
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So, you know, if you haven't made 25% of your meetings within a year, you know, that board, the chair and the staff liaison on the board can discuss that with that member.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:36:56.460
End: 02:37:04.460
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: If they haven't made 50%, they can make a recommendation to you all that the person be removed from the board.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:37:04.460
End: 02:37:12.460
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: There is just the standard provision in there that the board needs to adopt bylaws. Once they adopt the bylaws, they go to you all for final approval.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:37:12.460
End: 02:37:22.460
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: The board can never adopt their bylaws and you never have a saying that that process has to occur because they serve at the pleasure of the city commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:37:22.460
End: 02:37:29.460
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:37:29.460
End: 02:37:46.460
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: We outline in there just the standard officers of chair, vice chair, how those individuals are selected by that board as well as I believe we have in there that you can't serve in a chair, vice chair role for more than three consecutive terms.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:37:46.460
End: 02:37:57.460
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And by terms, I mean one year as a chair on that board. Meetings and meetings procedures.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:37:57.460
End: 02:38:06.460
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: We basically say in there that one you need to, you should set forth within your bylaws when your board is going to meet where they're going to meet what time.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:38:06.460
End: 02:38:12.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:38:12.460
End: 02:38:22.460

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:38:22.460
End: 02:38:31.460
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:38:31.460
End: 02:38:37.460

Member of the Public:
Start: 02:54:06.460
End: 02:54:21.460
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so I think it would be interesting like you've got this October 23rd, you know, kickoff point would be to have in the bylaws that the committee should consider the guidance, the commission provides at the start of the period.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 02:54:21.460
End: 02:54:28.460

--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 02:54:28.460
End: 02:54:39.460
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: That's going to change when the commission changes. So therefore just a simple line that says every year the commission, you know, the majority of the commissioners will provide this guidance to the board.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 02:54:39.460

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:54:43.460
End: 02:55:05.460
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: I think I see what you're saying. That's something that we've been trying to possibly, you know, as a new commission is created through an election, we bring these boards back to them, give them, and just, you know, we don't have to talk about it too long, but tell them about what these boards are doing, what they've done in the past, and that commission can give some feedback of, yeah, they're doing good or why are they doing that?

Mayor Hattisall:
Start: 02:55:05.460

Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: Well, I'll give you a specific example, actually we're going to talk about it in the next item, but when you have the social services or the special alcohol, one of the provisions I was saying to putting into the bylaws is that any organization would need one full year of operations that was could be reviewed or they couldn't qualify.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 02:55:28.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:55:40.460
End: 02:55:52.460
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And that could be said by the commission or could be put in the bylaws. I mean, it's something we could also facilitate to through our briefing sessions as staff liaisons are getting feedback or need feedback in direction.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:55:52.460
End: 02:56:03.460

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:56:03.460
End: 02:56:13.460
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So we just need to do a better job of consistently bringing it in front of you. So that five years doesn't go by and that our commission is like, what does this board do or why?
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 02:56:13.460
End: 02:56:23.460
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: But my thought is if we put specifics like that, and I agree with John on that should be a year, but we could just give that as annual guidance because you may get five commissioners and 10 years at the side.

Member of the Public:
Start: 02:56:23.460
End: 02:56:32.460

Speaker_4:
Start: 03:12:25.460
