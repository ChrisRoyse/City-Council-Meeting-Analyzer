--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:01:44.000
End: 00:01:55.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So earlier this spring, at that time, we talked about the customer interface, the technology that can be used to help manage parking within Aggieville.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:01:55.000
End: 00:02:01.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: We also talked about the cost associated with managing the program, the rate options.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:01.000
End: 00:02:03.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds

Start: 00:02:03.000
End: 00:02:05.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:05.000
End: 00:02:09.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And then the timeline and next steps for implementation.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:09.000
End: 00:02:12.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So that's what we talked about in March of this year.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:12.000
End: 00:02:21.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: This evening, we're here to update you on some of the various funding options for an actively managed parking program with an Aggieville.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:21.000
End: 00:02:30.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And then the timeline and next steps for implementation to move forward and implement those programs.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:30.000
End: 00:02:50.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: So in terms of funding options for a managed parking program, while there are many that we've evaluated and shared with you over the years, we believe that there's two primary methods that can be used to help fund the ongoing cost of the parking program.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:50.000
End: 00:02:52.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: One is the general fund.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:52.000
End: 00:02:54.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: The second is user fees.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:54.000
End: 00:02:59.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: In this case, it comes from user fees from the parking program.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:02:59.000
End: 00:03:18.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So in the option of a general fund, the parking management program would just be paid for out of the general fund, the cost of an active parking management program in Aggieville is approximately $400,000 on an annual basis to put some perspective in that.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:03:18.000
End: 00:03:31.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The second option is user fees and those user fees would be paid for and incurred by and burdened by the users of Aggieville that could be the business owners.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:03:31.000
End: 00:03:36.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: It can be the employees. It can be the guests and visitors that come to Aggieville.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:03:36.000
End: 00:03:44.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: But in the case of this, it's only the users of the parking system in Aggieville that would incur a fee.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:03:44.000
End: 00:03:54.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: If you were to walk bike or take some other mode like a lift in Aggieville or be dropped off, you'd certainly not incur those fees.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:03:54.000
End: 00:04:03.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: This is a similar user fee program to the one that you selected to pay for the improvements at the airport.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:03.000
End: 00:04:11.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So let's talk a little bit more about those user fees.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:11.000
End: 00:04:18.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: We have provided to you in the board packet we discussed in March.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:18.000
End: 00:04:26.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Again this evening, a link to the document that shows the three different parking rate scenarios that we have modeled.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:26.000
End: 00:04:31.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: I want to draw your attention to the bar chart on the right hand side of the screen.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:31.000
End: 00:04:35.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: There's a horizontal yellow line at the $400,000 mark.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:35.000
End: 00:04:46.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: That is the approximate annual ongoing cost to operate and maintain an active parking management program in Aggieville.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:46.000
End: 00:04:51.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: We're showing three different rate scenarios here on the right.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:51.000
End: 00:04:54.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: We'll talk about the table on the left in a minute.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:04:54.000
End: 00:05:06.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: But the blue line is a peer comparison to some of the other communities that match some of the unique dynamics of Aggieville.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:06.000
End: 00:05:11.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: Like Lawrence, Kansas, we've also modeled case states parking rates.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:11.000
End: 00:05:15.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: We have Ilarkin saw, Ames, Iowa, and Stillwater, Oklahoma.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:15.000
End: 00:05:22.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: You'll see that those rates are the highest parking rates that we're showing here in these three scenarios.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:22.000
End: 00:05:26.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: The recommended rate here is shown in Ray.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:26.000
End: 00:05:30.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: That generates just under $800,000 a year.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:30.000
End: 00:05:38.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: The main difference between the recommended rates, the peer rates, and the cost recovery rates is that case state,
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:38.000
End: 00:05:44.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: which is your neighbor adjacent to you to the north, has a paid parking program already in place.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:44.000
End: 00:05:49.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: We want to make sure that those rates are comparable to that of case state.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:49.000
End: 00:05:57.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: We don't have case state parkers parking in Aggieville or Aggieville parkers parking in case state.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:05:57.000
End: 00:06:02.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: We bring some harmony to the parking system.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:02.000
End: 00:06:12.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: The cost recovery rates are those that would be charged to basically break even with that ongoing parking program costs.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:12.000
End: 00:06:25.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Now again, in the cost recovery rate scenarios, there could be some challenges with case state parkers utilizing the parking garage on street or the two surface lots in Aggieville,
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:25.000
End: 00:06:30.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: which is why we would look to go with the recommended rate scenario.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:30.000
End: 00:06:38.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Now if I can draw your attention to the figure on the left hand side of the screen, these are the recommended parking rate these schedules.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:38.000
End: 00:06:48.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I can tell you in all these structure scenarios, our recommendation is to provide at least 30 minutes of free parking, particularly for on street,
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:48.000
End: 00:06:52.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: but we're also showing that as a recommended option for off street.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:52.000
End: 00:06:59.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: That 30 minutes of free parking is critically important for some of the businesses in Aggieville that have quick customer turns.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:06:59.000
End: 00:07:06.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: The varsity, I think, is a great example where you probably wouldn't spend a lot of time unless you're eating your donuts there.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:06.000
End: 00:07:13.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: But if you're picking those up in the morning and a cup of coffee, your stay is going to be relatively short.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:13.000
End: 00:07:26.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So we don't want to burden those types of businesses and have quick turn customers from having their customer base go elsewhere within the community and make sure that we can have good access to those businesses.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:26.000
End: 00:07:31.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: On street, we're showing a dollar and hour parking up to two hours.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:31.000
End: 00:07:37.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So it would just only be up to two dollars and two dollars or two hours to park on street.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:37.000
End: 00:07:44.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Again, for continuity, you want to stress the importance that on street parking is intended to be short stays.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:44.000
End: 00:07:54.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We can leverage all of the parking supply of the construction of the parking garage as well as the surface parking for longer term parking stays,
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:54.000
End: 00:07:57.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: particularly for those employees.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:07:57.000
End: 00:08:10.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Off street, we're showing, again, 30 minutes free, a reduced rate from that of on street parking at 50 cents an hour with no limit, but a maximum of two dollars per day.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:08:10.000
End: 00:08:20.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So that's the equivalent of four hours of parking if you stay for six, eight, 10, 12 hours, it's still going to be maxed out at two dollars per day.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:08:20.000
End: 00:08:36.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And then we have two options for parking permits. So if you are a resident within Aggieville or a business owner employee, you don't have to worry about being burdened with those daily rates.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:08:36.000
End: 00:08:48.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And we're showing two different rate scenarios because we recognize the importance of our hourly workers and part time workers that may not be there for five days a week.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:08:48.000
End: 00:08:56.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so there's an opportunity to develop a parking program that would have a reduced cost for those types of employees.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:08:56.000
End: 00:09:11.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So again, these are the recommended parking rates if you want to move forward with paid parking in Aggieville and use the cost generated from the users of the parking program to help support the managed parking program.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:09:11.000
End: 00:09:22.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Again, alternatively, you know, the second option is to have the general fund pay for these ongoing expenses and operations of managed parking.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:22.000
End: 00:09:30.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So before you leave that slide, the off street is essentially the parking garage.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:30.000
End: 00:09:32.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: Correct.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:09:32.000
End: 00:09:48.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: That's that makes up the highest amount of the parking. The only other off street parking that's currently in Aggieville is the two surface lots and then the few parking spaces that are available to the public in the hotel garage.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:09:48.000
End: 00:10:01.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So when you think about parking in Aggieville beyond this proposal of two and a half hours, being in the garage all day would cost you two dollars.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:10:01.000
End: 00:10:09.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: You can't stay on the street any longer than the two and a half hour time frame without receiving some sort of ticket.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:10:09.000
End: 00:10:16.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Did we talk about what that ticket price would be for a violation?
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:10:16.000
End: 00:10:21.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: We have, we didn't talk specifically in here about the ticket price for the violation.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:10:21.000
End: 00:10:31.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I will tell you that parking violations for the ticket price is not really an intended revenue street.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:10:31.000
End: 00:10:45.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: It's to discourage the use of over parking on street and because the cost of parking off street is so low, the cost for a parking ticket would want to be.
--------------------------------------------------

Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:16:07.000
End: 00:16:17.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:16:17.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:16:25.000
End: 00:16:34.000

Start: 00:16:40.000
End: 00:16:55.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds

Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:16:55.000
End: 00:17:10.000

Start: 00:17:10.000
End: 00:17:18.000

Start: 00:17:44.000
End: 00:18:04.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: And then the payment for that could be paid directly by the employer. So in the case of the permit that we would be using for Aggieville, it wouldn't be a physical sticker, although you could add a physical sticker or hang tag to a vehicle who would associate your permit with your license plate.
--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:18:04.000
End: 00:18:25.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds

Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:18:25.000

Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:19:18.000
End: 00:19:39.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: So in that case, we would be looking at a reserve stall or space or multiple stalls or spaces. Typically, when we have a reserved asset, we would want to charge a higher fee for that because it's for the explicit and sole use of a particular business or employee.

End: 00:20:02.000

But again, in order to do that, you're going to have to have a higher, our recommendation to have a higher fee for the sole use of that particular space or group of spaces.

Start: 00:20:02.000

--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:21:15.000

--------------------------------------------------
Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:21:27.000
End: 00:21:44.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And so if we want to be able to enforce during those hours or very late in the evening, it's certainly an opportunity what the cost burdened from the additional staffing would in most all cases not outweigh the new potential.

Andrew, Walker Consultants:
Start: 00:21:44.000

Start: 01:20:04.000
End: 01:20:17.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mark Bashamp:
Start: 01:20:17.000
End: 01:20:32.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mark Bashamp:
Start: 01:20:32.000
End: 01:20:46.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So in that area, that's that is what's taken up by the traffic by either the cycle track or the roadway. And so we have in some instances eight foot on one side, seven foot on the other, four and a half foot, five foot on the on the east side.
--------------------------------------------------
Mark Bashamp:
Start: 01:20:46.000

Start: 01:26:15.000
End: 01:26:31.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
