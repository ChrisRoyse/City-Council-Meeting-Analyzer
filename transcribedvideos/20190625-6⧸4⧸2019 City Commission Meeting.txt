City Manager:
Start: 00:38:24.520

End: 00:38:49.520

Text: But also, we talk about promoting commerce. When we do have these landscape trailers, other commerce vehicles trying to get through residential space, trying to do some of their business during the day, some of may be impeded by these large vehicles, such as our visage, which we'll talk about here.

City Manager:
Start: 00:38:49.520

Text: Our focus today is really addressing them at the nighttime hours in residential neighborhoods. So, not really during the daytime hours, but what the ordinance that we have in front of you talks about is making it unlawful to park on any public street, highway or alley, with any residential district during the nighttime hours, and nighttime hours are stipulated between one half hour after sunset until one half hour before the next day sunrise.

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:40:22.520
End: 00:40:34.520
Duration: 12.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:40:35.520

City Manager:
Start: 00:40:42.520
End: 00:41:02.520
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: What we're talking about is for our public streets and right away. And so, for instance, a picture in the screen right there, that would be an appropriate place unless your HOA, or neighborhood has a covenant, but to have a large vehicle parked on a private residential drive is appropriate any time during the day or night.

End: 01:08:03.520
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So, you know, again, our intent when we get to this point is that hopefully we've addressed those questions and concerns and it's one other thing I'd point out it's interesting that once in a while our code appeals board, for instance, the last code that we adopted, they actually added an item that was more stringent than the code they asked us to amend the code to make something more restrictive than is currently in there.

City Manager:
Start: 01:08:03.520

Text: So when we define what commercial kitchen what commercial cooking is or is not that can greatly affect whether or not those hoods need to be installed. So I think that definition now will better equip us to evaluate those situations and may result in that's not installing those hoods when by definition of a chemical code it's not necessary.

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:33:20.520
End: 01:33:29.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:33:29.520
End: 01:33:35.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:33:38.520
End: 01:33:43.520

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:33:49.520
End: 01:33:59.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: This is kind of a win-win that keeps us in contact with and keeps us engaged with the contractor community in this also gives them the ability to gain continued hours.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:33:59.520

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:34:07.520
End: 01:34:18.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:34:18.520
End: 01:34:26.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:34:26.520
End: 01:34:36.520

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:34:54.520
End: 01:35:01.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: We're going to get the UDO as far as all the zoning areas and the codes and everything was supposed to be simplified.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:35:01.520
End: 01:35:05.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And some of these are going to be into effect in 2020.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:35:05.520
End: 01:35:10.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:35:10.520
End: 01:35:19.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: The UDO will reference something shall comply with the building code or whatever, but essentially there are two separate documents.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:35:19.520
End: 01:35:29.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: If we have definitions that fall between the two, so if we have a definition or a building code and also exist in the zoning ordinances, we try to make sure that those two jives so that there's no conflict.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:35:29.520
End: 01:35:34.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:35:34.520
End: 01:35:39.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: Because it was supposed to kind of simplify some of those things is what I was thinking.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:35:39.520
End: 01:35:49.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I talked about the major significant cost to businesses and that's why we're not doing some of those fire codes until 2025.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:35:49.520
End: 01:35:59.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:35:59.520
End: 01:36:06.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:11.520
End: 01:36:16.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So I would tell you that my intention would be that we would stay in contact with those folks.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:16.520
End: 01:36:21.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: It would probably just be a yearly reminder of my calendar and touch base and see what progress they've made.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:21.520
End: 01:36:24.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: I don't expect that some of these people are just going to jump all over this right away.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:24.520
End: 01:36:30.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: But certainly when we started getting into that last year, if that thing's been accomplished, that contact's going to increase.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:30.520
End: 01:36:36.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: You could vacate a building if it really came down to that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:36.520
End: 01:36:40.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:40.520
End: 01:36:44.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:44.520
End: 01:36:47.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:47.520
End: 01:36:50.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:36:50.520
End: 01:36:53.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:36:53.520
End: 01:36:55.520
Duration: 2.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:36:55.520
End: 01:37:03.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And during that time when they have to put some of those comply with the new codes, they probably have to shut down for a period of time.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:37:03.520
End: 01:37:05.520
Duration: 2.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:37:05.520

Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:37:11.520
End: 01:37:17.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: That's one of the hidden costs that people don't consider when they have a fire too is loss of business.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:37:17.520
End: 01:37:20.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So there's going to be a loss of business to put the system in.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:37:20.520
End: 01:37:25.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:37:37.520
End: 01:37:40.520

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:37:40.520
End: 01:37:46.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:37:46.520

Commissioner Butler:

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:37:51.520
End: 01:37:58.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:37:58.520
End: 01:38:03.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:38:07.520

Commissioner Butler:

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:38:51.520

Commissioner Butler:

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:39:14.520

Text: So what we've done is we did a breakdown of the possible increase if the sales tax did increase by 0.3%. Generally you know research suggests that people spend about 30% of their income on taxable goods and services so what we did was we broke down you know a possible annual household income took that 30% of that income about what you would spend on taxable goods.
