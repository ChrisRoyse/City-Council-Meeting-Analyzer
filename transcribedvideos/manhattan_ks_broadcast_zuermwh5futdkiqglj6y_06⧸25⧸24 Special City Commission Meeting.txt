Text: We've done leaps and bounds regarding our corrections our professional staff and sworn staff were all in very good shape knock on wood which leads me kind of to the budget that unfortunately it's one of those things that with the Riley County Police Department the uniqueness of how things are structured I don't have to tell you folks about it but when we are a fully staffed or close to being fully staffed what we would normally see is in regards to salary savings.

Text: The exceptional rise of the cost of doing business whether it's gas whether especially insurance and pharmaceuticals those different types of challenges of the Riley County Police Department this is again like everyone else facing the same thing so looking at how we can restructure what our needs are staying fluid that there may have been some programs or some concepts that we invested in two years ago three years ago to that effect contracts or whatever you may have they may not be relevant.

Start: 00:08:54.440
End: 00:09:23.440
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: This year there may be a new priority or there we may see that the money that we have we can see better results and shifting in other places so through streamlining contracts through looking at shifting certain areas looking at losing individuals through attrition rates and then just putting staffing where we need to the department reduced the budget asked somewhere in the area of $330,000 internally that we did not come to the law of the budget.

Text: So that's the number of requests for our budget again I know that there are some very difficult conversations that are happening right now so we want to make sure that we stay extraordinarily humble to the current situation and but the budget while the approval of the budget was roughly I believe $1.8 million to the Riley County Police Department all of that money is going towards the salary survey.

Text: So instead of you know trying to implement the increases in salary to keep up with competitors and other cities instead of doing it in a course of over three years we've extended that out to a course of over five so we're not hitting as much all at once.

Text: Cola we stayed with the CPI looking at a 3.8 for a cost of living increase until I was important because we have not gone to or not doing a full implementation of the salary survey and then everything else went towards health insurance costs fuel and operational costs we didn't we're not looking to use that that money to purchase anything new or to move from those programs and with that being said I stand ready for any questions that the commission may have of me.

Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I know a lot of the city staff have battled this for a long time, and I know the commission is probably aware of this, but those communities around the youth that don't have an animal shelter and are not funding yours are just contributing to increased cost here in Manhattan.

Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And then with that increased funding, once we can get funding from those communities, which have been successful with Potawatomi County and Wemigo in some of those areas, then we can serve a higher volume of animals because we can increase our budget at that location, and that will then lower the cost for everybody.

City Clerk:
Start: 02:38:23.200
End: 02:38:31.200

City Clerk:
Start: 02:38:31.200
End: 02:38:40.200

End: 02:38:51.200

City Clerk:
Start: 02:39:19.200
End: 02:39:30.200
Duration: 11.000 seconds
