--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Reddy:
Start: 00:52:04.800
End: 00:52:18.800
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: It'd be a very simple action. It would just be the matter of right now the charter ordinance allows the employee benefit fund to be outside the six mills, which means sometimes in the future, it could be possible that the library would cost us more than six mills.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Reddy:
Start: 00:52:18.800
End: 00:52:28.800
Duration: 10.000 seconds

End: 00:52:55.800
Duration: 17.000 seconds

Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: That's a true statement. It's like a lot of other things that we do. And I do agree the library has done a good job, but I think I made it a point the past 10 years and making this an issue every budget cycle to be sure that the employee benefit fund is in there and they have kept it under six mil.
