Speaker_0:
Start: 00:43:51.640

Speaker_0:
Start: 00:43:58.640
End: 00:44:12.640
Duration: 14.000 seconds

Start: 00:44:12.640

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:44:28.640
End: 00:44:39.640
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: We actually utilized the definition of e-cigarettes and those types of products that are in the ordinance and then defined it with the e-cigarette shop.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:44:39.640
End: 00:44:49.640

Speaker_0:
Start: 00:44:49.640
End: 00:45:03.640
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And then we have an exemptions provision section within the ordinance today. So we're adding two areas where it would be exempted and you would be allowed to possibly smoke or vape in those areas.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:45:03.640
End: 00:45:28.640
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: So we exempt tobacco shops and we provide some definitions in there that essentially says that you can allow smoking or the use of e-cigarettes in a tobacco shop if that retail store does not share any enclosed common space or ventilation system that would comprise the rights of non smokers and non users in the area.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:45:28.640
End: 00:45:39.640

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:45:39.640
End: 00:45:48.640
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: You cannot go into an e-cigarette store and smoke tobacco because that would be actually against the state law because those are not exempted.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:45:48.640
End: 00:46:14.640
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: So we can't be less restricted than the state law and the state law doesn't define that there. So same definition there. If it is an e-cigarette shop it can't share an enclosed common space or ventilation system that would comprise the rights of non users of e-cigarettes and I should remove that non-smoker portion right there.

Speaker_0:
Start: 00:46:31.640
End: 00:46:44.640

Speaker_0:
Start: 00:46:44.640
End: 00:46:58.640

Start: 00:47:21.640
End: 00:47:38.640
Duration: 17.000 seconds

Start: 00:47:38.640
End: 00:47:51.640

I don't smoke cigars cigarettes won't go near a vape shop. That's just never been my thing and never will do it.
