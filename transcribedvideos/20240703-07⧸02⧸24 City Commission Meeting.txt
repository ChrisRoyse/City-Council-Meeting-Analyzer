Text: Yeah I thought we try to allocate those funds based on the theory that they're doing so much work for that fund like this is a joint maintenance facility so you say so much is getting on parks and rack so much is going here and it's more of an art than a science but as opposed to this is a stable fund I'm going to use a lot of money.

Text: Yeah well that's that was a little bit that's three to 400 K a year for the next 20 so that's a that's a sizable investment that we're making out of that fund but at the time again we looked at a lot of different options on this to try to land in an area that the commission was comfortable with financially.

Text: You all have discretion on this still before we issue the permanent debt you all can tell us one thing or another this was obviously what the commission saw witnessed we temp noted we constructed the facility but every time we go to issue debt we bring back these strategies.

Text: I mean I believe we need to move forward with these and hopefully get some good lessons learned for new projects going forward also I just like to get in the exercises we do this and we say there's going to be efficiencies we list what those are I mean the easiest one is that tire stuff that's pretty easy one to come up with but there's a lot of others in there too now with their budget challenge there's going to have to go out there take a lot of stuff out but I think it really makes you think when you have to go out there and take a lot of stuff out and I think it really makes you think when you have to go out there and take a lot of stuff out and take a lot of stuff out.
