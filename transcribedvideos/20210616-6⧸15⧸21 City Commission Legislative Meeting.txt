Text: So those that approach can exist. However, as Dennis highlighted, as you get more energy and more interests in art projects in your community, which are a great asset to the community, there is a best practice and a need for some policies that help create consistency for all the people or all the different entities that might want to engage with the city for public art.

Start: 00:31:31.160

Start: 00:32:01.160
End: 00:32:13.160

Start: 00:32:48.160
End: 00:32:57.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Start: 00:32:57.160
End: 00:33:10.160
Duration: 13.000 seconds

Assistant City Manager Dennis Marstow:
Start: 00:33:10.160

Start: 00:33:24.160

I would, the commission is very familiar with a public infrastructure process and the way that it involves design and construction and that you have from a design, you have a RFP, you might be doing a bid after the design phase to get your contractors and all of those things.

Start: 00:41:18.160

Start: 00:42:10.160
End: 00:42:24.160

Start: 00:42:24.160

Assistant City Manager Dennis Marstow:
Start: 00:42:37.160

Duration: 18.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:00.160
End: 00:46:03.160
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: They work with their capital improvement projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:03.160
End: 00:46:08.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And so these represent significant art and design projects connected to major capital improvements.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:08.160
End: 00:46:18.160
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And they're identified by the community art design committee, say staff, or the commission or community input.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:18.160
End: 00:46:23.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So that's something they attached to a lot of their major infrastructure and capital projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:23.160
End: 00:46:26.160

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:26.160
End: 00:46:35.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And that's where many works of art throughout Slina. Slime are provided through gifts. Others are commissioned for specific locations or specific projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:35.160
End: 00:46:40.160

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:40.160
End: 00:46:46.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then finally, the other important component I think what they have in Slania is what they call resource partnerships.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:46.160
End: 00:46:55.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And so they also work to provide resource assistance in individuals, organizations and businesses in the development of art and design projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:46:55.160
End: 00:47:01.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:01.160

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:16.160
End: 00:47:25.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Again, there would be a great resource for us in terms of having people that we're willing to work with us in developing some of the components that might be interested in here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:26.160
End: 00:47:31.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:31.160
End: 00:47:40.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: As part of a several years ago, as part of a park's recreation master plan, they also call for the creation of a master plan for public art.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:40.160
End: 00:47:46.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:46.160
End: 00:47:55.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:55.160
End: 00:47:59.160
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And so they determined a number of guidelines or things they wanted to put in place.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:47:59.160
End: 00:48:05.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Number one, they should establish a city of a life of public art program by ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:48:05.160
End: 00:48:12.160
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:48:12.160
End: 00:48:22.160

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:48:22.160
End: 00:48:26.160
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:48:26.160
End: 00:48:41.160
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And in their situation, they had a public art program, a staff person that was connected with the Parks and Recreation Department, but was designated solely for the role of arts program coordinator.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:48:41.160
End: 00:48:46.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So someone's going to work with all these projects in their community.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:48:46.160
End: 00:48:51.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And so they had about five different goals of what they were trying to accomplish with that program.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:48:51.160
End: 00:48:56.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:49:12.160
End: 00:49:16.160
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:49:16.160
End: 00:49:21.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:49:21.160
End: 00:49:25.160
Duration: 4.000 seconds

End: 00:49:31.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:49:31.160
End: 00:49:37.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:49:37.160
End: 00:49:44.160
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:49:44.160
End: 00:49:50.160

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:49:50.160
End: 00:50:00.160
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And they have done that just to try to really involve artists in bringing that perspective to the design development process in the community.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:00.160
End: 00:50:11.160
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:11.160
End: 00:50:15.160
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:15.160
End: 00:50:25.160
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: They establish an ordinance that both provided some funding mechanisms and also created a public art commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:25.160
End: 00:50:31.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And in their particular program, they developed arts and public places reserve account.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:31.160
End: 00:50:46.160
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so they will cause an amount equal to 1% of the construction cost of many construction projects that's equal to greater than $50,000 to be deposited into that public places reserve account.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:46.160
End: 00:50:58.160
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So they're really identifying a really most any type of project of any size of all and dedicated some funds for that particular account.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:58.160
End: 00:51:07.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Not necessarily using those funds for every single one of those projects, but they're building a fund through making that designation.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:07.160
End: 00:51:25.160
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: They're also they have an often level means of funding which they can actually if they choose to end lead out funds in the capital improvement program, they can also be fixing out of funding that they provide through that tool as well.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:25.160
End: 00:51:31.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:31.160
End: 00:51:48.160
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And they have a very well defined public art selection criteria that they follow and have all that laid out in the program and have again pretty well defined process for the approval and display of public art and the site selection.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:48.160
End: 00:51:56.160
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So they work with a public art commission that has a little bit more authority perhaps than just an advisory board would.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:56.160
End: 00:52:00.160
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And they have a staff liaison works with that public art commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:00.160
End: 00:52:06.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So you've seen maybe three different examples there of how some programs could be organized.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:06.160
End: 00:52:09.160
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: But they are again, as I mentioned earlier, I believe there are some common elements there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:09.160
End: 00:52:17.160
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And they have good resources for us in terms of looking at how we might move forward developing some of our policies here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:17.160
End: 00:52:21.160
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:21.160
End: 00:52:26.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds

Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: As we're wide out our presentations tonight, we hope to provide the framework of what a public arts program can look like in Manhattan.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:36.160
End: 00:52:44.160
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: But also give you better understanding of the complexity and attention it will take to bring this program to life and to have a robust program.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:44.160
End: 00:52:51.160
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: I know many in the community are focused on the development of an art donation policy, which is one component which we outlined tonight.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:51.160
End: 00:52:54.160
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: And the policy development is just the first step.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:54.160
End: 00:52:57.160
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: The implementation of the policy is the crux of the program.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:57.160
End: 00:53:02.160
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So yes, receiving money to support art sounds like an easy and can't be the first step.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:02.160
End: 00:53:08.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: But it will fall short and cause frustration if we don't have the resources for implementation.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:08.160
End: 00:53:14.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So city administration as we highlight does not see this as an ad hoc or limited time venture going forward.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:14.160
End: 00:53:21.160
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: But rather, this is a program that will need in-hand support and attention to deliver on the community's aspirations for the program.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:21.160
End: 00:53:28.160
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: As we noted, there are city resources from insurance and significant staff time needed to manage a public arts program.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:29.160
End: 00:53:35.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: If you do choose to go forward, we suggest that the only way we can implement the program is with additional staff.

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:35.160
End: 00:53:43.160
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Last week at our budget workshop, you heard from department heads talking about their struggles to deliver the services you expect with the staff and budget that they have.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:43.160
End: 00:53:56.160
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Recognizing this, that we are suggesting that if you want to move forward with the public arts program, we need to have one additional staff member to implement the program in policies that we will need to contain within that program to move forward.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:56.160
End: 00:54:04.160
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: We believe we can actually run the program with one new staff member with the working title of public arts program coordinator.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:04.160
End: 00:54:13.160
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: But realizing as we highlighted earlier, that there will still be resources needed from the city manager's office, city attorney's office, public works, parks and recreation.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:13.160
End: 00:54:19.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then of course, part of this will involve coordination of some of the public advisory boards.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:19.160
End: 00:54:29.160
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We identified a hiring range and salary for the position and we had looked to incorporate the position as we also considered the other staff requests for the 2022 budget.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:29.160
End: 00:54:48.160
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: One advantage is that if you do want to move forward with the creation of the public arts program and support the staff identified for the implementation of the program, it would give us some time to determine if there is some private support among the arts donors who would consider endowing the position or somehow support this position potentially both with public and private funds.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:48.160
End: 00:54:56.160
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: As Katie mentioned, if you want to consider percent for art program, that could be a funding source as well to pin on how extensive you want to create this program.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:56.160
End: 00:55:03.160
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Well, that would be a strong public private partnership opportunity. We can't plan on that without having full knowledge of what might be available.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:03.160
End: 00:55:09.160
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Our commitment is that it would take at least 100% of city funding for the position as we head down this road.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:09.160
End: 00:55:19.160
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So to conclude, we believe we have a strong framework for a public arts program and we have a community that's very eager to support a public arts program.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:19.160
End: 00:55:26.160

Text: The first inner city visit that we went on was to Columbia, Missouri. And a part of that visit was a discussion on public health. You might remember that we talked about how they worked with the community and education work together to use the schools for sporting events and recreation, much like we're doing now.

Commissioner Reddy:

Text: So that's my take on it. As far as the percentage of dedicated, something for a couple of funds, I think I could be wrong but my understanding is over the years the public and other organizations have presented so many types of proposals and this was suggested I forgot by with the organization that maybe we should dedicate a certain percentage of funds to this.

Start: 01:38:32.160

Start: 01:38:52.160

Let's, can we get that fairly quickly? And then we'll solve all these other issues over the next year or two and come up with a comprehensive plan once we see.

Start: 01:39:53.160
End: 01:40:11.160
Duration: 18.000 seconds

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:40:11.160

Start: 01:41:25.160

Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So I just clarification from what I heard. Basically, what I heard was essentially you want us to continue our ad hoc policy, but you want a policy that's going to invite everybody to donate art.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 01:41:38.160
End: 01:41:45.160

City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 01:41:45.160
End: 01:41:53.160

City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 01:41:53.160
End: 01:42:14.160
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: And so, therein lies the dilemma. Once we create the policy and we establish it either by a resolution or ordinance as part of your policy resolution, everybody knows that they can come forward, which will just put more burden potentially on staff. Maybe we're wrong. Maybe they're won't be. Maybe all we'll get is the art that we're seeking.

City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 01:42:14.160
End: 01:42:29.160
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So it's just one of those things where we'll continue, I guess, to spread it out to whoever has time to work on it. And we work instead of having a coordinator, we'll all gather in a conference room and who's got time to do this.

Start: 01:43:52.160

End: 01:45:26.160
Duration: 12.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:26.160

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:45.160

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:47:26.160
End: 01:47:38.160

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:47:59.160
End: 01:48:13.160
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I would think again you want to make it revenue neutral so if I'm going to build a statue give it to the city I'm going to have to pay for the installation of it and buy insurance for it because it needs to be revenue neutral that's my point and I think it's possible to make that happen I really do.
