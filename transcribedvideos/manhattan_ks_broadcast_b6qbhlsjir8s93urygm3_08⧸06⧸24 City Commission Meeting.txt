Commissioner Adam Jack:
Start: 01:16:21.760
End: 01:16:37.760
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So, in this scenario, what I added just earlier today was that when we have a benefit district, these 10 property owners, they're paying their same property tax, but they're also paying $5,000 a year and specials.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Jack:
Start: 01:16:37.760
End: 01:16:56.760
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So, under each of these numbers here, there should also be plus $5,000. What the RHD allows then is for the increment from the property tax improvement and the special to go towards retiring the debt that the city issued for the public improvements.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Jack:
Start: 01:16:57.760
End: 01:17:12.760
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Again, looking at this from a district perspective, we would be able to take the $57,000 we have an increment every year and the $50,000 and specials that we're collecting from these property owners and be able to retire that debt in about nine years.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Jack:
Start: 01:17:12.760
End: 01:17:23.760
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So, it takes half the amount of time because we have property owners paying their property tax and their special assessment in both of those things are being combined to go back into paying off the debt.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Jack:
Start: 01:17:23.760
End: 01:17:33.760
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Now, what that means is that for nine years, those property owners have special assessments that they're paying, but it's not the 20 years that it would typically be.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:17:33.760
End: 01:17:46.760
Duration: 13.000 seconds
