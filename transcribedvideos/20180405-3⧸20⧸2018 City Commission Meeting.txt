Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:07:40.000
End: 00:07:47.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:07:47.000
End: 00:08:01.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: We don't have showers. They're going to be in that reconstruction. We originally looked at epoxy flooring, which is really a high level locker room type of flooring.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:08:01.000
End: 00:08:15.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Since we don't have showers, excess of water, moving to a tile flooring similar to what we put in the new parks and recreation wing that's shown itself well has worked well in the restrooms there.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:08:15.000
End: 00:08:26.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So we're moving to a type of flooring. That's one example. There was pretty substantial cost with that. But the biggest cost is simply not moving the existing HVAC system.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:08:26.000
End: 00:08:34.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:08:34.000
End: 00:08:41.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: We hope to be able to move that. That was a little costly to do so instead of moving the entire HVAC.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:08:41.000
End: 00:08:51.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:08:51.000
End: 00:09:02.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:09:02.000
End: 00:09:16.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: We added, I'll say, late in the game, workstation, computer station out into the lobby. And we've done similar type of work ourselves and some of our facilities. And we have staff that can do that.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:09:16.000
End: 00:09:23.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So we felt like that was also something that we could pull out. And then we could afford that with our own existing budgets.

Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:09:23.000
End: 00:09:28.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds

End: 00:09:45.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Last year we had this discussion. A lot of it was around the failure of K-DOT basically to police all over the land that they have ownership of around particularly Seth Childs and some other places.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:09:45.000
End: 00:10:00.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: When I looked at the peace parts of the Mohing contract, there is one, a couple on Seth Childs. One is at the intersection of Kimball and one is at the intersection of Anderson for example.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:10:00.000
End: 00:10:14.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: But they appear to be largely along the sidewalk. And most of the difficulty comes on an offer amps between the ramp and the highway itself where it's, you get two or three or four feet of the ramp.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:10:14.000
End: 00:10:28.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I'm not sure what it is, it's grass and weeds. But is there any way to supplement K-DOT if they're only going to do it twice a year after it gets terrible and they cut it down?
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:10:28.000
End: 00:10:38.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: But is there any way to supplement that by having those companies do a brush hug cut maybe a couple times as well?
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:10:38.000
End: 00:10:50.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We move along those intersections that you speak of predominantly for the reason that we maintain the sidewalks as well. And so that's why we move on both sides of that sidewalk currently.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:10:50.000
End: 00:11:02.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We've moved that for many years. It's a little different style of Mohing than what you're speaking of where it is that gravel rock and I'll say a little more in rough vegetation.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:11:02.000
End: 00:11:11.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Certainly we could ask the contract more to give us a price for that potential change order and we could evaluate it from that perspective.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:11:11.000
End: 00:11:29.000

And we'll get a little bit more into those fees a little bit later on. But basically $6 for a one year license if you have a spade or that would be a one if you have a one year rabies vaccination, you get a one year license. So your rabies vaccination ties into the tier license year.

Text: We synced those up via ordinance. We also kind of changed some of our tactics and animal control. Animal control tactics have really swung over time. There was a while back. It wasn't very enforced. And then it went through a phase where someone say we were over zealous in our enforcement with people being asked as they're walking their animal in the park or other other items.

Text: And then kind of swung back the other way. Now the commission kind of kind of wanted to back off of that. So we weren't asking for the license whenever we had a call out. So that's something we've started to do. So basically a call out is you know being dispatched via RCPD to go out on a call. We're going to ask for that animal license when we're out there.

You notice when we talked last November there was one member of the vet community that showed up and that person represented a clinic that said we want to pay for the pay for the license at our clinic. We want to be able to do that collect the money and send us to the city.

Duration: 16.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 00:18:23.000

Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: So they should have to pay more for that process. We kept the minimum fines in the draft ordinance pretty standard 5100 500 so we've tried to do that with the noise ordinance and other ones we've done the last couple years where their minimum fines per violation that doesn't necessarily mean someone could the judge could decide okay we're going to go straight to 500 but it's a minimum so something to keep in mind.

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:43:50.440

Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:43:57.440

Duration: 11.000 seconds

Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:44:08.440

Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:44:19.440

Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:44:27.440

City Manager:

Mayor Morrison:
Start: 00:46:11.440

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:48:51.440

Commissioner Reddy:

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:49:11.440
End: 00:49:23.440

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:49:23.440
End: 00:49:31.440
Duration: 8.000 seconds

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:49:31.440
End: 00:49:39.440
Duration: 8.000 seconds

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:49:39.440

End: 00:49:56.440
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:50:14.440
End: 00:50:24.440

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:50:24.440
End: 00:50:32.440

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 00:50:49.440

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:51:09.440

Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So the other one that you didn't put on this slide that you had on another slide and I'd written down but forgot to say it is when we've done this on other ordinances, we've placed the staff at some risk by not backing them when they enforce the ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:52:06.440
End: 00:52:22.440
Duration: 16.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:52:22.440
End: 00:52:37.440
Duration: 15.000 seconds

Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 00:52:37.440

Commissioner Dodson:
