Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:06:28.000
End: 00:06:40.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:07:00.000
End: 00:07:09.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So it was out in the country and didn't have the infrastructure that was what we needed to develop it at the time the donation occurred.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:07:09.000
End: 00:07:19.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:07:19.000
End: 00:07:28.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And they later donated 10 of those 40 and so the city and the Certoma Club primarily were on a mission to raise funds to purchase those 30 acres.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:07:28.000
End: 00:07:40.000

Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Our literature review type of type research indicates a lot of discussion about either burials that were on the site in 1957 or potentially burials that were moved to the site in 1957.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:07:56.000
End: 00:08:06.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: There's no official record of that with we've checked the local archaeologist as well as the state archaeologist and there's no official documentation of those burials.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:08:06.000
End: 00:08:15.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:08:15.000
End: 00:08:31.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And so that's something that I think staff would also recommend but we look for your input on that tonight basically to find out if indeed there are remains or archaeological elements of significance that are in the park or were moved to the park during this time period.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:08:31.000
End: 00:08:42.000

End: 00:09:06.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds

End: 00:09:59.000

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:09:59.000
End: 00:10:14.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: The rocky ridge line here that was all part of the original 40 and then the 10 that was donated is kind of in this area where the road comes through and then the 30 acres is primarily the large prairie open space on the west side of the park.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:10:14.000
End: 00:10:24.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:10:25.000
End: 00:10:36.000

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:10:36.000
End: 00:10:52.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:10:52.000

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:10:59.000
End: 00:11:21.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: And so in September people started planning with the city and manager park board and Sertoma Club kind of took the lead on that they built some roads to get to the park in November of late that year of K state professor assigned some designs students to look at developing concepts for the park much like we did earlier with with this planning process.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:11:21.000
End: 00:11:41.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: And then the park board finalized those 13 plans down to one and they ended up having a plan that had the elements listed there shelter houses and picnic facilities and restrooms some observation points and then they began that construction in the winter and summer of 1959.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 00:11:59.000
End: 00:12:28.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: And then in so the park was dedicated on August 2nd of 1959 and here is current current embassy Warner and city manager west dedicating the park and then over the next couple of years additional roads and shelter houses and picnic tables picnic ball diamonds for pickup baseball games were all constructed and then throughout the the proceed the following decades we kind of list out a variety of activities and things that were occurring around the park at the time.

Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Thank you Eddie and good evening, Mayor and commissioners. As Eddie said, we've had some effort here over the past year plus, especially on the facility side to take a good look at how we do things and to probably bring some information to you to maybe take a slightly different approach with that.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:09:00.460
End: 03:09:10.460
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We didn't want to give you a little bit of a history on our past fee increases and this is more on the program side now as we'll speak about our program fees first in the presentation.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:09:10.460
End: 03:09:23.460
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: You can see going back about 15 years, we had an increase in 2003. We went really a six year period before we had another increase in so certain programs will increase a little bit more because of that longer period of time.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:09:23.460
End: 03:09:42.460
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: And then again, in 2013, we've put a $5 program increase in most program areas. And then again across the board of September 2016, which went into effect as January 1 of 2017 for our last increase with program.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:09:42.460
End: 03:09:50.460
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So we've had some incremental increases over the past several years and we think this more frequent and regular review is a good approach.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:09:50.460
End: 03:10:06.460
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So as those a percentage increase, I mean when we say like back in 2003, a $10 increase for dance and so on, is that how much was the course to start with?
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:10:06.460
End: 03:10:10.460
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: So just to give us some idea of what that jump might have been.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:10:10.460
End: 03:10:30.460
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: So we've put in back then. Probably we've had some of those bigger increases like that. Again, it kind of predates my time here, but it's something that we were probably trying to get them more in line with actual cost recovery in that situation because those are more extensive programs to operate.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:10:30.460
End: 03:10:50.460
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: So I don't know where they are wrapped. I do know that when we don't even offer the program along with the dance classes, for example, because of the number of the structures and the amount of costs there, we probably were trying to increase that cost recovery because we do have a little bit higher fee for that program now than we do for some of our other what I call base programs.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:10:50.460
End: 03:11:04.460
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So I'm guessing that's probably what happened there with some of those adjustments, trying to meet that. How about some we currently do like swim lessons? Most of those are in that $35 range.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:11:04.460
End: 03:11:08.460
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: Okay. And the dance, for example, would be more in that $65 to $70 range.

Start: 03:11:10.460
End: 03:11:24.460
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: A lot of our youth sports are also in that $35 range. So that's $35 ranges would kind of be your base fee that we have with a lot of programs and then other programs increase as necessary for expenses.

Start: 03:11:25.460

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:11:36.460
End: 03:11:50.460
Duration: 14.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:11:50.460
End: 03:12:01.460

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:12:01.460
End: 03:12:12.460
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And then we continue to increase with some additional program growth. So there's really two pieces of this. We've had some incremental fee increases over the last several years.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:12:12.460
End: 03:12:18.460
Duration: 6.000 seconds

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:12:19.460

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:12:28.460
End: 03:12:36.460

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:12:36.460
End: 03:12:45.460
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:13:04.460

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:13:52.460
End: 03:14:00.460

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:14:00.460

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:14:04.460

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:15:17.460
End: 03:15:30.460

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:35:00.460
End: 03:35:12.460

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 03:35:13.460
