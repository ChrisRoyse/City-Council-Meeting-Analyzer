Text: The resolution establishes what we're calling group rate which I'm going to define here a little bit more but that's a cheaper rate at $5 because we understand that there's a large influx of people coming into the garage.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 00:56:05.280
End: 00:56:22.280
Duration: 17.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 00:56:22.280

Speaker_1:
Start: 00:56:54.280
End: 00:57:07.280
