City Manager:
Start: 01:35:36.000
End: 01:35:48.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: That's obviously a water treatment facility, a wastewater treatment facility study, where this is really looking at the collection system on the sewer side distribution system on the water side.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:35:48.000
End: 01:35:56.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 01:35:56.000
End: 01:36:01.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:01.000
End: 01:36:12.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 01:36:12.000
End: 01:36:21.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:21.000
End: 01:36:35.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:35.000

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:42.000
End: 01:36:54.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: One of the things that the previous master plan update didn't really do is focus on storage needs within the existing system that looked at expansion into new growth areas like blue township.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:54.000
End: 01:37:02.000

City Manager:
Start: 01:37:02.000
End: 01:37:12.000

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:40:59.000
End: 01:41:05.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:05.000
End: 01:41:13.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: When we start moving into this type of evaluation, the first thing we need to do is determine what's the community going to look like 20 years down the road.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:13.000
End: 01:41:20.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:20.000
End: 01:41:27.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:27.000
End: 01:41:37.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:37.000
End: 01:41:43.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Beyond population growth, we need to project how much water we're going to need in the future.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:43.000
End: 01:41:48.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:48.000
End: 01:41:56.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: One thing to note, you can see these peaks and valleys here. This is the historical data from the city over the last 20 years.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:41:56.000
End: 01:42:01.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 01:42:01.000
End: 01:42:08.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: That means that over the recent years, the water demand has decreased on average, even though population has increased.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 02:17:46.000
End: 02:18:04.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 02:18:04.000
End: 02:18:17.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 02:18:17.000
End: 02:18:32.000
