You start to see a much larger impact when you start to have overnight tournaments, which is precisely what would happen if we get a world class course designer like John Hauke, who the city has already spent $5,000 bringing in to help design a course and to finish the project that is already completed.

End: 00:50:15.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And listen to the folks from Emporia who have this experiencing that this brings in revenue to our communities, I think it would be a much better decision to move forward with the Coral Berry plan, or if not have some plan in the future for establishing a full 18 whole disc golf course within the city limits that is a professional grade that could bring in tournaments.
