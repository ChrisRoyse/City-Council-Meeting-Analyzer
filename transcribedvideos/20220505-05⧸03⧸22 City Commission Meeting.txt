End: 01:20:56.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:20:56.000
End: 01:21:07.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Changes we can talk about those as well and I'm starting with kind of probably the least the least amount of change with our first item and to the greater changes that would be in the fourth item.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:21:07.000
End: 01:21:26.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So this is this is a clip from your city code we codify most of our city ordinances in the Manhattan city code of ordinances chapter two is our administration chapter that we've talked about this here this is just a table of contents the articles that we're going to talk about are contained in chapter two.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:21:26.000
End: 01:21:46.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: Our first discussion item is actually revising article four divisions one and two and I again that's just showing the current table of contents for these sections this is all in the code city code of ordinances and of course this in your packet there's really not a lot of substantive change here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:21:46.000
End: 01:22:15.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: This article will be revised to implement some of the items from the Kansas code of procedure for municipal courts that we should have adopted a while ago you have in your packet with each of these discussion items a draft ordinance we're not adopting these ordinances tonight but I wanted to give you a draft so we'd be farther along in our feedback on these and in that draft ordinance there's comments on every section is to what part of the code that was from or.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:22:15.000
End: 01:22:44.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: Why that change was made but this discussion item number one is redoing article five and it's really just most of the text of from this is in the Kansas code for municipal courts these are the things that the code says that the commission is supposed to adopt some of it we have in our current code and some of it we do not for example really easy thing we do not have in here is the state law stated that the governing body has to adopt by ordinance when the court meets and where it meets and we have not.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:22:45.000
End: 01:23:13.000
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: Previously done that it's we have obviously been holding court a certain way for years and that's incorporated in the code in this new ordinance so most of the changes in this discussion item it doesn't change anything substantively about what the municipal court is doing or has done nothing what it does is it updates it to the statute and adopts the things that we were supposed to adopt I'm happy to answer any questions or take any feedback on this discussion item number one or we can do that at the end whatever you all prefer to do.

Speaker_0:
Start: 01:23:13.000
End: 01:23:25.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: I'd like to do it as you go through each one that way stay on track but I have any problem with this is all pretty much administrative and doesn't doesn't change much for me so I'm all for no problem.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:23:25.000
End: 01:23:38.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Others okay Katie I think we're fine with the draft the proposed wording thank you I was hoping that would be the response there's really not much to say about that one.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:23:38.000
End: 01:23:53.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Discussion item number two is the it's in the same chapter it's article two and this is where there's not as much we have a couple points we need to talk about here a lot of the changes in here are also.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:23:53.000
End: 01:24:03.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Overall they are not changing what you do but there's a few prime important changes we're going to talk about but this again is a snapshot of your table of contents the sections we're going to change.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:24:03.000
End: 01:24:31.000
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: Again you have comments in your draft regarding the changes a lot of the changes as you can see are in the existing code where they've been moved around are updated one thing I want to note before we get into feedback is that I did eliminate outdated emergency provisions these two provisions one of them is a cold war provision that talks about emergency government only in the circumstance of a foreign government attacks on Americans on our soil.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:24:31.000
End: 01:24:58.000
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: And it's just very specific in the way it's written and so that's really not the type of emergency government provision that cities have these days and the second one is talks about when if the majority of the governing body is killed in a common disaster who becomes the governing body again these are not the kind of modern emergency provisions that cities have we need to we talked about this during the pandemic we need to talk about that at some point.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:24:58.000
End: 01:25:08.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: These provisions do not assist us they did not assist us during the pandemic they're outdated I'm suggesting that we just go ahead and repeal those as part of this.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:25:08.000
End: 01:25:26.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Everyone understanding that if that's something the commission wants to revisit in the future we'll do that when those laws are that the legislature is working on some of those laws now we can talk about it after they do the things that they are going to do but that's one thing I want to note that those provisions are in here but they're not really effective regardless.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:25:26.000
End: 01:25:43.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Okay so here are the keys substantive changes to the ordinance that's that's in discussion item number two which I should know I've broken that ordinance into two discussion items because the first article is the governing body and then the second part is the city manager and we can talk about those parts separately.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:25:43.000
End: 01:25:55.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: There's some pretty big things here that we do want to talk about and I want to go over and briefly and then take your feedback most of this we've previewed before these aren't new subjects for the commission to hear but seen it and writing is new.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:25:55.000
End: 01:26:06.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So the first one is a just it's a place to start for a process to fill commission vacancy you will recall that one of the charter ordinances that you just adopted.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:26:06.000
End: 01:26:29.000
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: Charters the city of Manhattan out of a requirement that if the there's a vacancy in the governing body that a special election must be held if the position is not filled within 60 days and you might also recall that when that was adopted the league suggested that cities charter out of it and replace it with a provision that works for them so that you don't have a for example a special election right at the same time as a regular election.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:26:29.000
End: 01:26:43.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: As we mentioned before most cities did that we did not so we chartered out of it what we have to do though when we charter out is create our own substitute process for filling a commission vacancy this is commission only.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:26:43.000
End: 01:26:57.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I have some language here basically it's pretty wide open and this is how the state law was before it was repealed and that is that basically the commission gets to decide how they want to fill a vacancy when it occurs.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:26:57.000
End: 01:27:26.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: That's still that's still how it's set up so if that vacancy occurred at that time the commission can meet and suggest say here's how we want to do this the one thing that is recommended and I saw in other cities that I I think is worth considering and I do have in here for you to review is that if a vacancy occurs after the filing deadline in an election year no reappointment is made in that period of time unless it's needed for the quorum.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:27:26.000
End: 01:27:55.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So this is a situation that has arisen in other cities where you they already have knew who the candidates are and if in there's an unexpected vacancy in September or someone intentionally steps down in September that sometimes there could be a motivation for a governing body to select from the candidates go ahead and put them in office before that election so it's there's quite a few cities that have the same provision it's really just to avoid that political problem of between June in between the election.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:27:55.000
End: 01:28:15.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: That you have an issue of because remember you're you're going to have four commissioners to start with at least four so you probably have a it's possible you would have a split and so although that's in here you could also change it at the time it's still within the commissions purview to change this down the road but that is something that I I thought we should talk about.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:28:15.000
End: 01:28:44.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So the vacancy provision that we need to get something in there just for clarification we repeal those others the charter ordinances but these are going to be regular ordinances that we put in so from from that standpoint just like you said whatever we pick the next day theoretically if we want to do next meeting theoretically we could change correct you have to do two readings but correct I know yeah that's one advantage commissioner of moving these to the ordinary ordinances is that they're easier for you to change.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:28:45.000
End: 01:28:49.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: So I'm going to move on to the next meeting in the future.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:28:49.000
End: 01:29:14.000
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: The other substantive change again we've talked about this this is changing the meeting time this the proposal and we this is in in consultation with the city manager's office would be to change to a six o'clock meeting time for all meetings and what I mean by that is that these regular meetings that now start at seven o'clock would start at six o'clock and work sessions which are on the odd the odd Tuesdays they would start at six o'clock as well they could be in the meeting time.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:29:14.000
End: 01:29:37.000
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So that's six o'clock as well they currently start at five thirty one reason that we're proposing that to you at least for consideration is that it's easier for the public if the city meetings always start at the same time so it's you know the city of Manhattan on the first and third Tuesdays the meeting starts at six and the same on the second and fourth Tuesdays it starts at six it's something that's known it you don't have to do this but this is just our thought process.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:29:37.000
End: 01:29:58.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: The other thing that this does is we are we are supposed to by ordinance set our meeting times and we are in the governing body is supposed to make changes to that we've had a charter ordinance that we repealed that's in the process of becoming ineffective all that ordinance did was set regular meetings on the first and third Tuesday at seven p.m.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:29:58.000
End: 01:30:18.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: It has no process for moving those it had no process for work sessions it had no process for briefing sessions and this league book that we all have been referring to the governing body manual says that if you don't have a process for moving those meetings and your regular meeting occurs on a legal holiday you have to convene that day and either do business or move your meeting.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:30:18.000
End: 01:30:30.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: That's not and what the league says is don't put yourself in that position create a process where you you as a governing body set up your meetings and you can move a meeting by majority action there's no reason to make it so difficult.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:30:30.000
End: 01:30:47.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So a few things for you to consider and with the meetings are change in your meetings starting at six and there's no briefing session anymore that would be incorporated into the agenda for your regular meeting and I have some examples of that that we can look at but that's the proposal that we have to do.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:30:47.000
End: 01:31:06.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: That that's the proposal for that aspect and then the last thing is the governing body salaries we had a charter ordinance that set the salaries you're required to set your salary by ordinance what you could set in the code or in the salary ordinance we have it set up in this draft for your consideration that you would just put it in the salary ordinance annually.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:31:06.000
End: 01:31:31.000
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: And then one thing we need to talk about there is automatic escalation the charter ordinance did have an automatic escalation provision it stated that every three years it went up it increased unless the commission adopted a resolution to refuse that increase that is something that we tripped over this year you might remember we had to go back and amend the ordinance because we weren't sure when that three years you know that three years cycle is easy to lose track of.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:31:31.000
End: 01:31:53.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: We if we want to do an automatic escalation what we started with is a proposal that the governing body just goes up at the same cola as everyone else it's really simpler on the HR side it's simpler from an administrative side you don't even have to have an automatic escalation I want to be clear I put it in there because that was in your charter ordinance and it's a point of discussion for the commission tonight.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:31:53.000
End: 01:32:00.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So these are the three main areas I've kind of briefed him and then I'm happy to answer any questions or take any feedback.

Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:32:04.000
End: 01:32:22.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: All right, I'm sure yeah I'll give you some feedback I like the six o'clock meeting I mean for the work sessions I still like 5 30 but I can give the six but I think for the regular meetings I like that.

Commissioner Hattiesel:

Text: Agendas that other people have I mean we've had that briefing session I really like to see the beginning of our meetings to have a section in there where it's a free flow of commissioners talking because of the coma rules it's hard for commissioners to know what other commissioners are thinking and I say six o'clock.

Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:32:43.000

Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I'm sure there's a lot of people who have a free flow of commissioners and I know we're going to talk later about the boards I think a section in there where we can review those applications and talk about them and show that we have a consensus so we know where the commission wants to go with those board members.

Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I agree with that I think you know six o'clock would work and instead of having the you know the pre meeting that you know people get confused with if we just started six but have the agenda change so it says okay we started six we talk about agendas we talk about boards we have you know free commissioner discussion and then limited to put a timeframe on it so that it has to end by seven or sooner so that we can get to the main items and then it's on camera we've always had you know that discussion that you know people can't see it.

Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And this would eliminate all that so I'm I'm in favor of of going with that and I think there was one other item here farther down didn't mention which is city manager I think section two three two it says qualifications he does not have to live in the city limits.

Text: Okay so I think or two sixteen for the replacement is there anything that says typically trying to insert something about instead of just picking randomly somebody to a point for that I mean we don't have a process so like the fourth vote getter of that election is that something that's done in any other city

Text: somebody that may have been interested in serving on the city commission but came in fourth I don't know like how would you go about just appointing do you just have an appointment process I don't know what that process would look like to fill a vacancy so I would like to see a little bit more on how people go about finding somebody I would assume it's somebody that's interested in the position and may have wanted to do it that's that's what I was thinking about if you have that fourth or fifth candidate that came in and fourth place or

Commissioner:
Start: 01:35:25.000
End: 01:35:39.000

End: 01:35:53.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Commissioner I can respond in the ordinances themselves the city's kind of divide into two categories and one is the ordinances are like ours which is they don't dictate a process because the governing body determines that process when the vacancy arises based on the vacancy.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:35:53.000
End: 01:36:22.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: A couple cities have a more specific process it's usually nominating committee that's in the ordinance we've had vacancies occur before and Ron could probably speak to him better but we've had vacancies where we've done both where we've the governing body has decided in a vacancy that they're going to appoint a person who had experience because of the need to get someone in their faster and then a vacancy where we took names and so the ordinances themselves don't get into that level of detail typically.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:36:22.000
End: 01:36:29.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And cities might take different approaches when they actually are faced with a vacancy.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 01:36:29.000
End: 01:36:50.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: I would just add that the experiences we've had we've tended to have those towards the end of a term so the time for your appointing this temporary position is usually could be six months or eight months as opposed to if it happened you know just after their term if they were in a serious accident or something like that and could no longer serve.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 01:36:50.000
End: 01:37:11.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: That's a situation where you might take a different approach versus somebody that you're just looking to finish that term in general I know former mayor commissioner Rich Sideler was called on twice to come in and do that because they were both times where that was a fairly short duration for that to occur.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 01:37:11.000
End: 01:37:20.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So there's just it does somewhat depend on you know which what commissioner who it was and what how much times left and what are those circumstances.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:37:20.000
End: 01:37:30.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Okay so I just thought maybe having two or three options on how to do it so just for future reference because you may not may or not be here I don't know how that would look.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:37:30.000
End: 01:37:40.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: To select that person I think starting at six o'clock is fine I don't typically the way I always saw briefing sessions was we're supposed to be able to do that.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:37:40.000
End: 01:37:50.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We're supposed to be updating each other also on what we did on certain committees that we are representing and calendar issues or agenda items that Ron might bring forward to us.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:37:50.000
End: 01:38:04.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I don't if it's boards and stuff I want to talk about boards when we get to board section so that's not something I want to discuss it for two seventeen at this point in meetings and I would like to see what those samples would look like if we're going to have an agenda.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:38:04.000
End: 01:38:26.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: I know the Board of Education has something like a briefing session that's also televised before their actual work session where they actually vote on items and it's very informative and it's more like a work session let's say more than a briefing session they actually have presentations and such and the voting process takes place after they gavel in.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:38:26.000
End: 01:38:48.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: So I want to know a little bit more about that six o'clock session to make clear that items to be discussed or whatever it might be but usually we're supposed to be updating each other also and this way we can update the community about the different boards that we are on and calendar items, military items, other league items or whatever calendar items that we talk about.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:38:48.000
End: 01:39:00.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So I think that would be very informative and I think it's good to have it consistent at six p.m. and making sure that all of them have the same process and if we have dinner or not at six I don't know.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:39:00.000
End: 01:39:16.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: I know when the Board of Education would eat dinner and they're doing it they were called out like you know you shouldn't be eating when you're talking so that might be something to look at do you eat and then come or you're going to block it off till six twenty and then open it up for Commissioner comments or how that would look.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:39:16.000
End: 01:39:28.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: You're shaking your head. Go ahead. We discussed that internally and because it starts at six we felt that that would give people ample time to eat dinner on their own and that we would be focused on the business and not eat dinner beginning at six.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:39:28.000
End: 01:39:41.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Excellent. Yeah I think that's a good idea and we would all be sitting up here is what I'm assuming. Correct. Okay. So this would be that that clarifies a lot for me as far as eating and things like that and that would go until seven and we would start a legislative session at seven.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:39:41.000
End: 01:39:56.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Go ahead. Or before or before. Oh yeah so like Mark was saying so it would be start before if we ended at six thirty or does it break out in our agenda like briefing session and then seven o'clock or how does that look on an agenda.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:39:56.000
End: 01:40:07.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So right now we have determined what our agenda looks like in the governing body policy manual resolution that was adopted in 2018 and it says just the basic parameters for the agenda.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:40:07.000
End: 01:40:23.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So that's something that we need to change an update as whatever we decide on these ordinances and when we get to that section which is a discussion item yet tonight I have some sample agendas but the questions you're asking are things we need to talk about where you put that Commissioner discussion on the agenda and how it plays in.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:40:23.000
End: 01:40:29.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: I will tell you just from a general perspective before we get into the I have some samples for that part of the discussion.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:40:29.000
End: 01:40:43.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: They're fluid meetings they're not stopping the meeting if they have a discussion item work commission they're not they're going straight to the next item they're not saying okay we're done at six thirty we're going to break till seven because that's they're just it's going all the way through.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:40:43.000
End: 01:40:51.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so we can talk about that I think it will be helpful to see some how some other cities actually incorporate that into their agenda in a couple slides.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:40:51.000
End: 01:41:03.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Yeah that clarifies it better for me so we start off with the pledge then because at the word of ed they would they would have their work session then they would stop and then at six thirty or something they would do their regular session okay so it would be fluid like Mark was in.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:41:03.000
End: 01:41:09.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Yeah other than that for those those that's my feedback on the three items thank you.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:41:09.000
End: 01:41:36.000
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: Yeah I wanted to I didn't come in on that you know if there's a commission vacancy I don't have a problem with the process the way it's written where we just figured out based on circumstance but but I do like that provision in there that if there's election coming up that we just leave it vacant so that we're not pointing somebody you know within three four months of an election because because I hadn't thought about your comment there that could leave room for some shenanigans and that's a good way to prevent that from happening.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:41:36.000
End: 01:42:02.000
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: Just curiosity question if someone vacancy someone dies God forbid or whatever but they had a longer term and you go into regular election is there like two elections then or I mean is that one position set off to the side and held as a separate election and the other three commission spots are in their own little election there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:42:02.000
End: 01:42:11.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: If you fill the vacancy then that person just fills to the expired term and so it doesn't impact which positions are open for election.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:42:11.000
End: 01:42:20.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Well I'm saying you're within that time frame for the election but that person that would be elected is wouldn't be up for election at that point in time.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:42:20.000
End: 01:42:31.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Only if that position would have been up for election but for the vacancy so if that position was it going to be up for election then if that position if that person was not up for election then the new person who replaced that position
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:42:31.000
End: 01:42:41.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: would just continue to the end of the expired term. If that person who left office was up for election then that same person who was replacement will also be it for elected.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:42:41.000
End: 01:42:57.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: Okay yeah I wasn't thinking of it that way I was thinking more of not doing it because of the expense of a special election with the idea being if there already is going to be an election why would you have the commission do it there's no extra cost let's just have the public decide.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:42:57.000
End: 01:43:06.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: That is part of it to commissioner actually I mean that is one reason the league recommended it because the statute is clear that you would have to have two elections potentially.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:43:06.000
End: 01:43:14.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Oh right but you know that is an aspect of it but the other issue is considering how your appointment would interfere with a slate that's already.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:43:14.000
End: 01:43:20.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Right you would have to have two elections but conceivably you wouldn't have to pay for a special election.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:43:20.000
End: 01:43:24.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: It would depend upon how it fell in relationship to the scheduled regular election.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:43:24.000
End: 01:43:49.000
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: Yeah because my thinking was well if it felled in through the election it's not special there's no harm no foul let the person run for reelection I'm glad I actually asked the question I didn't realize that part so if that term isn't expiring then it doesn't fall under that because it's within that election so okay good now I understand which is the answer.

Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 01:43:49.000
End: 01:44:18.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: Mark if you want to I don't want to don't need to say much but yeah I'm fine with the six o'clock thing I'm fine with just the commission determining what process the one to use and I would leave the three year thing on the salary thing in place for now but yeah that idea of being able to vote it down when that three years comes up leave that as an option I see.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:44:18.000
End: 01:44:39.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: And if we and commissioner had a cell brought up the escalation clause on the salary and so that's something that we did repeal as part of the charter ordinance but we but you're right we need to discuss that the current charter ordinance increases every three years we can put that in the ordinary ordinance which I understand that's what you're suggesting.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:44:39.000
End: 01:44:58.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Is that and we can also put in the ordinary ordinance the same thing where you can reject it by resolution that's fine to move over there so I guess if any other commissioners have comments about escalation I'd appreciate hearing those but that sounds like what commissioner has to suggest you just use that provision from the charter ordinance and move it to the ordinary ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:44:58.000
End: 01:45:25.000
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: I'm okay either way I think our salaries what we receive the compensation we receive is so low anyway so you know if it if it mirrors this the step in the raises that the city employees get it's still minimal because it has been $25 every three years I think is that what it's got to be done.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:45:25.000
End: 01:45:35.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I think it's $20 per month every three years I think it's $20 actually years it's 20 yeah it's $20 per month so in your annual salary years because of 20.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:45:35.000
End: 01:45:46.000

Speaker_0:
Start: 01:45:46.000
End: 01:46:01.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So the section 10 of the salary ordinance that we just passed which has a specific amounts but I think any you know what what commissioner had us all suggest we just put it in section 10 of the salary ordinance and we approved that every couple years and we should be good to go.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:46:01.000
End: 01:46:15.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Yes and that's how it's currently written commissioner is that the salary ordinance will set the would set the amount but what I was asking is if you want an escalation clause in this ordinance so that when we prepare the salary ordinance for you we have guidance on that you know then we it's predictable.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:46:15.000
End: 01:46:29.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: We don't have to do that we can just simply address it in the salary ordinance also we don't have to and then our ordinance here that we're talking about today would simply say that you'll set it annually your salary annually that's and then we don't even have to address the escalation clause and that's the feedback I needed from.

Speaker_0:
Start: 01:46:29.000

Start: 01:46:32.000

Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I wanted to ask about on page one it says four commissioners constitute a quorum of the governing body it's under two dash fourteen that's what it is now and so is there any need to change that to three can we is there a time when two commissioners cannot be ever be here have we ever encountered that or do we just one two are gone we cancel.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 01:47:08.000
End: 01:47:23.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Let's say manager address that that would be the case and I was trying to think so in the original quorum of four what the majority of quorum or the quorum of four was in the charter ordinance did I remove in that to the normal ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:47:23.000
End: 01:47:36.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The charter ordinance states that the quorum shall be four unless the governing body adopts a quorum of three by ordinance so actually the charter ordinance had an option in there and that we do need to adopt we're required to adopt our quorum by ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:47:36.000
End: 01:47:48.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So we need to put whatever quorum this commission desires in this ordinance it will because the quorum will be repealed with that charter but the current charter ordinance said for as a default by three was an option.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 01:47:48.000
End: 01:48:01.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So one of the things you might consider it's germane to the discussion of replacing the commissioner because if you dropped a forward you decided to keep it vacant and somebody's gone you can't meet so you can never.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:48:01.000
End: 01:48:30.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So if that happens in conjunction with that decision you might change your quorum back to three if you had four but I think you know with the zoom thing now electronics that even if somebody's gone unless they're incapable of getting to a computer or an iPhone or an Android phone I mean you should be able to be in the end so I don't see that as a problem I just leave it for if we didn't have the ability to do it electronically then I would say we need to move it to three.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:48:30.000
End: 01:48:53.000
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: It's important to have for just to have a discussion I think and yeah we've made so many available ways to be part of the meeting so I think just for pure discussion sake it would be good to have four people present but that's not to say if you're in a meeting like to notice something that's still only three.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:48:53.000
End: 01:49:07.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Will you be covering electronic meetings later in a presentation yes okay we won't talk about that so okay so we're basically saying we want a quorum to be for continue to do that okay.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:49:09.000
End: 01:49:20.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: That has been a discussion in the past I do support the six o'clock start and the seven o'clock and I just see it as being one continuous meeting.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:49:20.000
End: 01:49:40.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: With that separation has caused us expense having to give extra notices to because we've you know just a clumsy way it works so I do support I want to do what's efficient with that with regard to salaries I support the salary ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:49:40.000
End: 01:50:08.000
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: So the briefing session I would envision it typically being at six o'clock and the main meeting starting at seven for legislative meetings but a briefing session would be at work session would just command six o'clock is that what we're other people are how are you interpreting what we're saying.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:50:08.000
End: 01:50:32.000
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: So the briefing session has a separate meeting will be eliminated I understand so the work session I think if you're referring to on the odd so these are the non legislative meetings those would also start at six o'clock on on the both meetings with started six correct on the night of the legislative meeting I I agree about the need for the commission to have more informal talk and I would envision that starting at six o'clock.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:50:32.000

Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Yeah I think when we so we do have some sample and just to look at because it's part of our policy manual resolution but just to preview that issue one thing that we'll need to talk about when we as we have members of the public coming to so some people if they think it's like just casual discussion before calendar or the things that happen.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:51:01.000
End: 01:51:11.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Now they might think to show up at seven in your correct commissioner mounted they could take up but we could start their item at six thirty and so that might create more confusion for the public.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:51:11.000
End: 01:51:20.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So that's something in things like proclamations what time do they show up so these are things that when we get to that we kind of need to think about where is the best place to put that.

End: 01:52:16.000
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: And that does that mean you go to the fifth one I think you've encountered things like that in the past and so I think there has to be a process to be I'd rather than just leaving it wide open I think there does need to be a process developed a basic nothing elaborate but just because we would be substituting the public's judgment for our judgment on a new member.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:52:16.000
End: 01:52:20.000

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:52:20.000
End: 01:52:37.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: As Batgirl on the state statute currently says that the governing body selects the person to fill the vacancy with no guidance on how the governing body does that and then the statute says if you fail to do it within sixty days you must have a special election regardless of when other elections or all those things we've talked about.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:52:37.000
End: 01:52:53.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So the statute itself doesn't create a process for the governing body and we could and we can and that's something to think about just as a reminder that's what I'm talking about is that we give it a little bit of form or substance it doesn't have you know it doesn't have to be detailed.

Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 01:52:53.000
End: 01:53:04.000

Start: 01:53:04.000

Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: That's what this is always structure and it could be as simple as asking the public we got two weeks anybody that wants to be considered send in their resume to the city commission will sit around at a briefing session and talk about the pros and cons and try to come up with something and we could probably throw our own people's names in the hat to or so but I don't know if we yeah I think it's going to depend a lot on the situation.

Start: 01:53:32.000

Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Yeah if it's just like a couple months or so we can probably agree okay let's call Tom Phillips get him over here fill in these last two months and then we can go to the next election comes along so you're saying we can figure out when the time comes keep it simple in the in this part.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:53:51.000
End: 01:54:03.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: That is my recommendation that's what the state law says and as we've said the how the commission wants to address it is going to depend upon how much time is left in the term the circumstances for the vacancy and all kinds of things and so.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:54:03.000
End: 01:54:20.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: It's allowing that flexibility for the governing body at the time is is the recommendation this ordinance is just the overarching theme you have the over are just excuse me over are seeing a rule you have the opportunity to do that if we put something in here we can do that it may not be the best fit for.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:55:25.000
End: 01:55:39.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Reads exactly like this which is that the choices on the basis of administrative ability and not limited by residents the city commission can change that so if you would like to impose a residency requirement that's something this commission can do but just as background for.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:55:39.000
End: 01:55:57.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: The reason it wasn't there before was because the state law had that same language and we've had a city code provision that was consistent with it we could have chartered out of that state law though years ago we just have this is how we've written it so if there is feedback on that but I just want to give that background on the residency.

Text: The other aspect though is that there are unique circumstances and you may be in a situation where you're recruiting and you have you may want to hire somebody that's going to commute for a while a lot of times you see residency within a year or something like that depending on their situation and where they're at but those are those are a lot of different issues.

Text: I think when we were doing our CPD director we wanted them to Dennis Butler to move here to stay in the city and I don't know how it is for other agencies like the Flint Hills Regional Council or even the current director that you're looking for or anybody like that but I think the city manager position is very different than other department heads position so I would hope because the city manager is very involved in our community and with the relationships with the university and the chamber and all of that.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:57:53.000
End: 01:58:20.000
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: I think becoming very familiar. It would be important when you're making decisions especially budgetary decisions for the city that you also reside in the city so I I think we should look at that just a little bit closer I mean if they move here within a year so that's fine too if they're seeking a point from another state and wanting to move here that makes a difference but eventually having a residence here would be important.

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:59:36.000
End: 01:59:53.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Changes the first is 234 B sorry two dash 34 B this is a provision in here that basically says in writing that the city manager their design can refuse entry or ask someone to leave public property.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:59:53.000
End: 02:00:05.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: The reason this has been added this is the inherent authority of the city manager this is something though that when we have had a situation where we've had individuals in city property in the police.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:00:05.000
End: 02:00:17.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Respond to that to remove the individual they always ask us can you show us who has the authority in the building and we write down the person who has authority to say this person can't be in the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:00:17.000
End: 02:00:28.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So it's primarily for trespass this is something other cities haven't writing so that in those situations we can say yes the manager their design had the authority to say that this person needs to be removed from the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:00:28.000
End: 02:00:45.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And that's it's really just something we've been asked about in the past and the second part of that sentence is we have a couple policy manual resolutions that we've talked about updating historically about real estate but we talked about adding this just to make it clear that the manager.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:00:45.000
End: 02:01:07.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: So we can allow a lease or license or temporary use of public property under our control we do this already if there's a lease some of the leases we bring to you some of them are city manager consigned this is something we don't have to put this in here but it's it's really just trying to bring some certainty to something that we've been doing and this is only applying to leases it's not applying to the sale.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:01:07.000
End: 02:01:36.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So we've got a couple of reasons or any of those things any kind of conveyance so that's new and then the last thing to note there was there were sections two dash fifty seven through two dash sixty two these were bond requirements for the commissioners and for various employees and those have all been repealed with the exception of the city treasurer and so this new section two dash fifty seven is the exact language from the state law adopted for our ordinance for the bond for our city treasurer.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:01:36.000
End: 02:01:58.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: I've I've removed all the other bond requirements because we weren't following it strictly but also we now cover our employees and their performance through our insurance plans which is what most cities do they cover that that way so we can put those back in they would be based upon our prior code and not state loss and state law does not require many more.

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:01:58.000

Text: Well that statutes I guess we're talking about two different points in the process I'm saying the governing body could create a process but at the point of rejection that statute applies but you could still have some oversight and feedback to the mayor before that appointment is made as part of the policy manual resolution so you could have a process where my end goal is to make it so the commission if they do not want to accept the mayor's recommendation they can go ahead and pick the candidate of their choosing.

Text: Oh in that case then you have to either charter out of that state law or change the original ordinance yes change the original one of those two paths for the those boards okay so so we need to change the original ordinance so now in this situation with the ones that we have were captured by that state law unless we just do the resolution to say that based on that state thing to say the unqualified or unfit and as you said we don't have to give an explanation.

Text: Yeah so the you bring up a point commissioner that the league who gave us the advice that it didn't apply to us who are now changing that that they told us you bring up the point and I that's one reason I called and talked to him about that advice too because in a commission form of government as you noted the mayor only has any authority the commission gives the mayor but in our case we've given our mayor the ability to a point in all kinds of situations and that's not the right thing.

Text: majority most of them do but not all of them and so any of the ones that don't say that aren't subject to that statute so we'd have to rethink the whole of it like if you want the mayor not to appoint in the traditional way we need some feedback on well how does that process look and how does that play out for the governing body to have that responsibility.

Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 02:33:48.000

Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: The other thing is right now I think that it's it's to our I if we're going to do this we need to do it and not drag it out because we have some boards that are going to start having core of issues if we don't get some appointments made to them.

Commissioner:

Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:36:07.000

Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:36:13.000
End: 02:36:36.000
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: In the sense of you want to spare if the commission doesn't it's it's not going to happen very often and when I think we don't need to make wholesale changes to this thing there's just every so rarely an isolated incident where I think the commission the three three votes on the commission might not approve of a appointment.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:36:36.000
End: 02:37:05.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: But I think I think if you if you want to spare the potential embarrassment of saying you're unfit then we should the easy way is charter out of that thing and then we can just at the at a meeting say no three of us don't like that but ideally if we can have some discussion a week meeting or two before at this discussion hour whatever we call it after we accept it yet put in the six o'clock starting.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:37:05.000
End: 02:37:34.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: We can have some of that discussion and if somebody feels it feels really strongly about some somebody on the board coming up for a reappointment we can talk about it then but I think the solution which is what we kind of wanted over the last couple months to spare any potential embarrassment is it's let's get this let's get ourselves chartered out of that state statute that requires us to say somebody's unfit in order to not appoint them instead of just saying we don't want them appoint them.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:37:34.000
End: 02:37:47.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: We don't want them appointed for no reason and we can maybe even avoid it by getting them back off the appointment list before it's published so I think I mean I mean I'll wait what you intended but that may be this simple solution.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:37:47.000
End: 02:38:03.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: I think if we're going to change the process then we aren't making mayoral appointments we're making a majority of three will be who makes the appointments and this will happen again under the current thinking there'll be more people rejected.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:38:03.000
End: 02:38:29.000
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: And so we're going to start a new pattern until July or it depends on when we get the thinking together to actually change the process because right now we have a process that's formal and that's how it needs to work until we change it and adopt another another process.

Commissioner:
Start: 02:38:29.000
End: 02:38:58.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I'm not sure I'm a little confused I think the process we've had has actually worked I think because we are only mayor for one year we're not mayor for four years so after you will mark mark that mean and then so there isn't this one side for lack of a better word taking over our boards I think it's it's very balanced and oftentimes we've respected that I think once in a while we may offer somebody else's name or we may have a chance to do that.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:38:58.000
End: 02:39:18.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: I think that's the same question but it hasn't been practice it hasn't been the way we normally do business I think I've said at least 99% of the votes yes to mayors to when when was mayor to all of his appointments and I think traditionally that's how we followed it because we also want our boards to be balanced.

Commissioner:
Start: 02:39:18.000

Commissioner:
Start: 02:39:25.000
End: 02:39:54.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I think it's okay for their a dirt to be a resolution where they do say if they're unqualified or unfit instead of just saying I don't like them where they've been there too short if that's the case then they need to state that and it should be done ahead of time so if that person that has been selected by the mayor to be appointed they should have a space for them to come and advocate for themselves instead of being caught off guard they should have some knowledge of oh they're not going to appoint me I should show up they think that's not going to be a good thing.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:39:54.000
End: 02:40:21.000
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: I should show up they think this this and this I think that gives voice to to that person we may still not appoint them or we may appoint them I don't know but that gives that space to our community members which are volunteering their their time to serve on these boards as good citizens with good intent and and I think we need to hear them out instead of surprising them us being surprised maybe that's what we signed up for but the community didn't sign up for that.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:40:21.000
End: 02:40:44.000
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: I think that's it's extremely important to give them a heads up and I think putting it in a note and it's in our packet that they know you should probably show up and speak to this so I don't think the way it is right now the the one that the league is suggesting or might be changing I don't think it's a bad policy I think it's good because I think it keeps everybody in check and there won't be any surprises anybody.

Commissioner:
Start: 02:40:44.000

Text: Well one I'd say we tried to get this for a couple of months to have a discussion beforehand and we couldn't get that we have a going to do it and I think we need a way that if the majority of the commission has an objection to someone they should be able to
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 02:41:13.000
End: 02:41:37.000
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: bring it up the other thing is to keep it the way it is you really saying to me there's another tradition of how we pick the mayor which is totally tradition and isn't anything there and it'd be like why should three commissioners vote for someone for mayor if that's not who they want for mayor especially for any key appointments the way they are.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 02:41:37.000
End: 02:42:05.000
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: So this I think it allows us to keep the tradition and have that ceremonial post but you know let's take away the non ceremonial part of it because it's even in there that is what our mayor is supposed to be is ceremonial and all of us thought before this revelation with even the league having to change their manual as part of the revelation that the three commissioners still was final dictate.

Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 02:42:05.000

Commissioner:

Speaker_0:
Start: 02:47:04.000
End: 02:47:10.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And let me say this that that sort of violates our equal opportunity policy.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:47:10.000
End: 02:47:16.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So commission I hear two things here so if we can address back to the policy that we're discussing.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:47:16.000
End: 02:47:33.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So two things the first one is you want an opportunity regardless of the back in let's ignore that first second you want some kind of opportunity to give some feedback on what whoever the mayor brings forward so you want whether and you all can discuss that so maybe the mayor puts them together that's in your discussion items you can give that feedback.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:47:33.000
End: 02:47:39.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: That's that's something that we can accomplish with with a new policy that's not an issue.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:47:39.000
End: 02:47:48.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: The back end thing that commissioner Butler brings up is where nominating from the floor while your opinion is that the statute doesn't apply and I respect your opinion.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:47:48.000
End: 02:47:57.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: That is that I read the bill from 2008 and it does not have the limitation that it only applies to certain form of government and I reviewed the legislative history.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:47:57.000
End: 02:48:03.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So the league misinterpreted it and when I called the league and asked them about that they immediately changed.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:48:03.000
End: 02:48:16.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So the statute the plain language of the statute which is the rule of interpretation that we follow is it just says if if the setup where the mayor makes an appointment confirmed by the governing body.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:48:16.000
End: 02:48:38.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: So in order to do the part that you would like commissioner Butler and allow the nomination if it's refused that is achievable as long as we get out of the statute that's it we can accomplish that if we charter out of the statute or if you change your ordinances so they no longer same error appointment and you create a governing body process like the one we just talked about you could do it that way as well.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:48:38.000
End: 02:48:45.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: That's going to take a little bit longer because you would have to actually change the ordinances and as we've talked about those are in all kinds of different locations.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:48:45.000
End: 02:49:04.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: It's not impossible to do it's just we'll have to go through those and identify those spots that we would need to change it so we can accomplish what if the majority of the commission wants an opportunity to do that we can accomplish that the back end nomination from the floor but that that we'll have to deal with that statute and we'll have to charter out of it or change your process.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:49:04.000
End: 02:49:33.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So those are your options and I think the first part it sounds like we can work that into our agenda or work that into a policy in terms of that review but it's the backside it's the back end the rejection scenario where we may not have clear guidance on the next step because of the we'd have to have four of you who are willing to consider not vote tonight a charter ordinance so that we could bring that to you for discussion and then that would provide the opportunity to change the policy manual.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:49:33.000
End: 02:49:41.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So that's the guidance that we would need tonight to return with the charter ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 02:49:41.000
End: 02:50:02.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: Yeah so we'll have to see if there's four to do that but the other thing is none of this gives us enough time for June 3rd if the mayor keeps those nominations on the table we'll have to have that resolution for the next meeting to reject those two appointments.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:50:02.000
End: 02:50:11.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Correct. We would follow states we would be following state statute then.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 02:50:11.000
End: 02:50:15.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: Right we don't we don't have enough time to do it any other way.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:50:15.000
End: 02:50:25.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And that's the mayor's decision whether or not to withdraw those appointments or to remain on the table so under our current system in the future that may not be the process.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hattiesel:
Start: 02:50:25.000
End: 02:50:31.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: I guess we do we have three of us who want to have that resolution ready.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 02:50:31.000
End: 02:50:39.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Yes if we can't in my mind yes if we can't change this thing in time we got to go that route.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:50:39.000
End: 02:50:50.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And what would that resolution be so the statute requires if that the resolution must declare that the appointee is unfit or unqualified for the office.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:50:50.000
End: 02:51:00.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: It has to be a finding of the governing body it does not have to give a reason for that that's also been interpreted by the attorney general so it would just have it will say here's what the law says we're making a finding that so and so.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:51:00.000
End: 02:51:12.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Is unfit or unqualified to hold this position so the resolution so let's let's back up the second so which.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:51:12.000
End: 02:51:21.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So the the appointments that the commission rejected a couple weeks ago that was an invalid rejection of those pointies right correct.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:51:21.000
End: 02:51:41.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: Okay so as of so this 45 days we're talking about is if if the commission doesn't do anything they'll we'll go in it'll be reappointed based on the fact that they haven't been approved by the commission right so the resolution would be to go ahead and find those people unfit for whatever reason that will not be stated.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:51:41.000
End: 02:51:51.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So that's what we're looking at resolution wise to do what we thought we did last meeting when we voted them down that's what the statute would require yes.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:51:51.000
End: 02:52:06.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Okay yes that's what what is our option like if we say no what happens sorry commissioner no to to adopting the resolution.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:52:06.000
End: 02:52:33.000
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: It's a it's like any resolution there'll be a vote on the resolution like I mean there have to be two readings like no what happens does she just nominate and I and then someone makes a motion for adoption of the resolution and then that would be seconded to be voted on the resolution I mean what happens if we didn't do like if it was voted down if the resolution was voted down what happens well then the appointment would be made.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 02:52:33.000
End: 02:52:54.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: But but clearly you know the three of us that voted that down are more than likely going to prove the resolution so that's just I know but you know it's a discussion thing you know you may as well just you know understand I think there's three votes there that's what we intended to do we just have to do it the hard way now instead of the easy way because of legal interpretation.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:52:54.000
End: 02:53:23.640
Duration: 29.640 seconds
Text: So we did not do the mayor withdraws them in which case we don't have to do a resolution if she doesn't and we have to do the resolution but this was a discussion item so can we still vote on it as a vote tonight just to tell her to bring it she needs to know if there's three commissioners to know what it put it on the agenda right way to do this is to develop a new policy that takes over at the point at which the this dissolved this if you would draw the politicians and so there's no
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:53:23.640
End: 02:53:44.960
Duration: 21.320 seconds
Text: gray area in between there are no employ appointments being caught up in it there's nobody being embarrassed I mean you're not budging an inch but you expect me to budge I mean well now we'll just pass the resolution if you don't want to let's say and let's talk about how we can do this in a in a
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:53:44.960
End: 02:54:14.120
Duration: 29.160 seconds
Text: organized way we just want to get out of this 45 days we have a time crunch we need to get out of the 45 days willing to do everything you said we just need to take care of this 45 day period so this is what what it boils down to if you keep the two appointee appointments on the agenda for next month that we're invalally voted down last month by the three of us
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Linda Morse:
Start: 02:54:14.120
End: 02:54:31.120
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: then someone's going to make a resolution to find those three those people unfit and there'll be three votes and so there will be not a ferned or you can just withdraw those two nominations and and that would be the end of this scenario

Text: I'm still in that process I haven't concluded anything right as well all this came up new but and you've got she is that a requirement that they agree or can she simply withdraw the mayor decides whether or not to withdraw the nomination I think what the mayor is saying is my understanding is she's consulting with the nominee whether they would like to be to be considered

Commissioner:
Start: 02:55:24.160

Commissioner:
Start: 02:55:50.680
End: 02:56:04.360
Duration: 13.680 seconds
Text: the way I understood it I could withdraw the nominations or the people could withdraw their own for themselves and so that's what I was pursuing this afternoon before the meeting

Commissioner:
Start: 02:56:04.360
End: 02:56:15.120
Duration: 10.760 seconds
Text: you get to make the ultimate decision yes and and she and what you're also alluding to she wanted to see if they want to continue their position and then keep them on there was what she was waiting for

Commissioner:
Start: 02:56:15.120
End: 02:56:31.800
Duration: 16.680 seconds
Text: so either way what I hear from from the mayor is she if they are interested she would like to go ahead and reappoint them she's not going to take her own initiative to withdraw those nominations so with that you can move forward with the resolution or not I am not in favor of of the resolution
