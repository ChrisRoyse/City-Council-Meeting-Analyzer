--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:21:37.000
End: 00:21:55.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:21:55.000
End: 00:22:03.000

Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:22:03.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:22:18.000
End: 00:22:31.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So we think and that one doesn't have the tight timeline of year. We have to have it all spent by year end. It goes well into I think we've got two years to spend that maybe three.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:22:31.000
End: 00:22:46.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So that may be an avenue to help with some of the staffing as well. So we have to remember the process. We have to go we have to hold public hearing and develop a plan for that 300,000. So that's something we're working to bring to you.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:22:46.000
End: 00:22:53.000

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:09:29.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:09:40.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:09:45.520
End: 02:09:52.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:09:52.520
End: 02:09:57.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:10:03.520

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:10:06.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:10:16.520
End: 02:10:23.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:10:49.520

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:10:52.520
End: 02:10:58.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:11:02.520

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:11:10.520
End: 02:11:18.520

Text: Also in 2008, we added some more alternatives for how we contract for public improvement projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:11:18.520
End: 02:11:26.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:11:26.520

Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So what we're doing tonight is considering an increase to the change that Dennis is going to talk about.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:11:44.520
End: 02:11:58.520
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: But I wanted to note just for a framework that Dennis might cover this as well, but as a framework, the charter ordinance just as a reminder only applies to the public construction reconstruction of public improvements.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:11:58.520
End: 02:12:04.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Dennis is going to talk about how it fits in tonight with the purchasing policy and those other things we do.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:12:04.520
End: 02:12:10.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: But just bear in mind when you're thinking about the charter ordinance, it's all this aspect of it is one niche of what we do.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:12:10.520
End: 02:12:17.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And it's just the construction of public improvements. It's not all the other goods or services that we purchase through the city.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:12:17.520
End: 02:12:25.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: But it is important because the dollar amount in here is the first step in making a change to other things we purchase.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:12:25.520
End: 02:12:32.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Which Dennis is going to talk about. But bear in mind, I just don't want us to mix up that this is like a purchasing policy or some kind of broader purchasing.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:12:32.520
End: 02:12:39.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: It really does only relate to the process to contract for public improvements.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:12:39.520
End: 02:12:45.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Great. Thank you, Katie. And as she alluded, really this is kind of a three document process.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:12:45.520
End: 02:12:51.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And this is just the first one to really set part of the framework that kind of guides the other two. It will bring to you.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:12:51.520
End: 02:12:57.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: What she highlighted there in bullet two is about it does not apply to repair and maintenance of public improvements.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:12:57.520
End: 02:13:08.520
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: We have brought these items to you in the past in different regards. But as we are going through since it's been since 2008 that we've had this look at our purchasing documents,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:08.520
End: 02:13:14.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: the other two resolutions we'll talk about, but primary of the charter ordinance thinking about all the work we've done.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:14.520
End: 02:13:19.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And basically in the last year, we've done over $30 million in some improvements and things.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:19.520
End: 02:13:27.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so as we've been working through our processes internally, we've identified a few things that we want to bring for you some changes.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:27.520
End: 02:13:31.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And so really there's four things on the proposal that we're going to bring for you tonight.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:31.520
End: 02:13:38.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: One is talking about increasing the city manager's purchase and authority from that $20,000 up to the $75,000.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:38.520
End: 02:13:42.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: Also, there's a couple of components within the charter ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:42.520
End: 02:13:50.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And then some of our other subsequent documents where how the standard by which we award a bid is determined or how it's communicated.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:50.520
End: 02:13:55.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And so right now it is on the lowest and best responsible bidder.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:13:55.520
End: 02:14:01.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: As we've gone through our documents and had some discussions with some of our past bid processes,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:01.520
End: 02:14:10.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: we realize there's some important nuances to that about having to be the lowest responsible bidder who submits a responsive bid.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:10.520
End: 02:14:14.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And the responsive bid has been some of the things in question in the past.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:14.520
End: 02:14:20.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Also, there's a provision in here that you are probably familiar with where when we bring you a project,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:20.520
End: 02:14:24.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: every project has an estimated cost of probable expense.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:24.520
End: 02:14:34.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And so the charter ordinance has been pretty prescriptive that it has to be under the oath of the city engineer that provides those estimates.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:34.520
End: 02:14:38.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And so that does not allow, what we want to say is let's modify that a little bit,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:38.520
End: 02:14:46.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: and allow a department head or consultant to also be able to provide the estimate under the authority of the city manager's appointment.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:46.520
End: 02:14:56.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So that's a nuance in there as well. And then one of the processes that we have in place is that if all the bids come in and they exceed the estimated probable cost,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:14:56.520
End: 02:15:00.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: then we have a process in place over 7%.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:00.520
End: 02:15:03.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: That do we reject it? Do we bring it back to you?
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:03.520
End: 02:15:13.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We want to make sure that we have a bit more language and leeway that we can still go forward with some projects even though the bids may have exceeded the estimated cost.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:13.520
End: 02:15:20.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: But in a manner that really does have some outline rationale from city staff, whether it be that we have to do some for project schedule,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:20.520
End: 02:15:26.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: that there's some federal state regulations that it's important to go forward, or if there's some market conditions out there.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:26.520
End: 02:15:37.520
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so what we found is as we look through this document and some other documents, these are kind of the four things that we think will help improve our purchasing process for public improvements,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:37.520
End: 02:15:40.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: as well as some other purchasing projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:40.520
End: 02:15:49.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So the first item on there we said is we want to bring forward to you is increasing the city manager's current spending limit from the 20,000 up to the 75,000.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:49.520
End: 02:15:56.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And so we did do a survey of other cities and we put this in some of your documents with more cities, but just kind of the highlights there,
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:15:56.520
End: 02:16:03.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: as you can see the other cities, some of them in comparable size, some of them bigger, some of them smaller than Manhattan.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:16:03.520
End: 02:16:10.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And then even you can see anywhere from 100,000 about the top authority a city manager has for spending in Kansas cities.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:16:10.520
End: 02:16:24.520
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And then if with a little bit regional look, we have the Iowa and the Oklahoma College Town comparisons to also see how some other communities are approaching spending in the city manager's authority.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:16:24.520
End: 02:16:34.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And so as you're looking at this, we did a look back to 2018 about what would this impact be? Would that take a lot of items off the agenda process or not?
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:16:34.520
End: 02:16:45.520
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: But as you see, a lot of things that we bring before you are actually already items that are either identified in the CIP budget or have been authorized through the budget process.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:16:45.520
End: 02:16:54.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So what we're doing then is taking that extra step to come before you to actually have you look at the document more closely as we go forward with the BITS.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:16:54.520
End: 02:16:58.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: But also as you're well aware, it's nice agenda legislative packet.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:16:58.520
End: 02:17:05.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: The warrant register or a list of all the city expenses is part of every city commission legislative agenda and available online.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:17:05.520
End: 02:17:11.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So we do have the transparency about what has been approved and authorized that may not have come before the city commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:17:11.520
End: 02:17:19.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so to give you a sense of what the impact is in 2018, all of our meeting agenda items total about 412 items.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:17:19.520
End: 02:17:26.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And of those, 123 were purchasing related. Again, many of them were identified in the budget process.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:17:26.520
End: 02:17:39.520
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But then you can go down a little bit further to break down is to see that 65 items were between 20 and 100,000, 56 kilo of the title between the 20 and 75 and then 42 items were between the 20 and 50,000 range.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:17:39.520
End: 02:17:50.520
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So you can kind of get a sense for us to understand what would be some of the volume that the city manager may approve based upon this increase spending authority.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:17:50.520
End: 02:18:03.520
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Right now, because of the COVID situation, you did increase the city manager's purchasing authority back in March as part of some other measures you took for temporarily addressing some things to the pandemic.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:18:03.520
End: 02:18:12.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And so right now the city manager's temporary authority is at 75,000 and that is in effect through December 31st, 2020.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:18:12.520
End: 02:18:21.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And that really has helped us be effective and be nimble and efficient during the pandemic while also maintaining the transparency and accountability.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:18:21.520
End: 02:18:30.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: We report to you in Transmital Notes every time the city manager has spent over the 20,000 limit of his old authority up to 75 is new authority.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:18:30.520
End: 02:18:36.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then again, everything over 75,000 today still comes before the city commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:18:36.520
End: 02:18:44.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: What we have seen as we said earlier is that we think this authority will actually help reduce and we note will some the number of items on the city commission consent agenda.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:18:44.520
End: 02:18:51.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So that way we're allowing more time for you as commissioners and policymakers to focus on our priority issues.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:18:51.520
End: 02:19:02.520
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And then since you see since the last six months during the pandemic with the temporary authority, the city manager has approved 30 items between the 20,000 and 75,000.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:02.520
End: 02:19:09.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And even some of those actually were related to maybe some change orders of existing projects that you already did approve or adopt.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:09.520
End: 02:19:16.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And so all those were communicated to you by Transmital and they're available in the agenda packets as well.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:16.520
End: 02:19:21.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: But again, many of those items were COVID pandemic specific items.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:21.520
End: 02:19:26.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: Others were some things that you would see but just had a change to them.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:26.520
End: 02:19:34.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Also, we wanted to say that in changing the ordinance, the purchase of an authority now is one of the four things.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:34.520
End: 02:19:39.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So as you look at the just the authority of the city manager is one component.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:39.520
End: 02:19:49.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We also wanted to put that in here now with the other three changes instead of having to come back and forth and keep adjusting our ordinance to do nibble here and nibble there.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:49.520
End: 02:19:56.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: This is what we've kind of evaluated over the last 10 years has some changes that we need.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:19:56.520
End: 02:20:06.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And then you'll also see at the end where the city attorney is going to talk to you about what the process is for changing an ordinance, which is a little bit more onerous than just doing a resolution.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:20:06.520
End: 02:20:14.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So if we're going to do this, we want to do all four components at one step tonight as the first reading.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:20:14.520
End: 02:20:22.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So I'll turn it back over to the city attorney and she can kind of outline our process for adopting a charter ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:20:22.520
End: 02:20:32.520
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So as a reminder, the charter ordinance, the dollar amount in that it is a precursor to the other purchasing policy decisions and it coincides with them.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:20:32.520
End: 02:20:40.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: But in the charter ordinance, it only impacts the projects that are over that value, the public improvement projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:20:40.520
End: 02:20:44.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: So from a charter ordinance only perspective, it really doesn't change anything.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:20:44.520
End: 02:20:50.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Very few of our public improvements are 20, you know, between 20 and $75,000.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:20:50.520
End: 02:20:59.520
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: If we do proceed with the charter ordinances, as Dennis said, we have to have an affirmative vote for any charter ordinance of four commissioners for it to be considered adopted.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:20:59.520
End: 02:21:07.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: The Kansas Constitution requires that it be published in the official newspaper for two consecutive weeks and separate weeks.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:21:07.520
End: 02:21:11.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: It doesn't take effect until 60 days after that second publication.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:21:11.520
End: 02:21:16.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So there is a delay in the effective dates of any charter ordinance that we adopt.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:21:16.520
End: 02:21:20.520
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: There is an opportunity for someone to contest the charter ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:21:20.520
End: 02:21:28.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: There's a petition provision and the details are up there, but essentially the petition does not.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:21:28.520
End: 02:21:34.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: No, a five of charter ordinance, it just sends it to a vote of the electorate.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:21:34.520
End: 02:21:40.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:21:40.520
End: 02:21:46.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then as, as we said, the effective date cannot occur until the expiration of the protest period.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:21:46.520
End: 02:21:51.520
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And so this is the first step of the first reading of increasing the spending authority.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:21:51.520
End: 02:21:57.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Again, if you choose to move forward with authority, there would be some other actions that will happen within the next 60 days.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:21:57.520
End: 02:22:15.520
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: As we were talking about, there are some companion documents, and this is really a three kind of document process, where we also have some information, which we call the resolution for city purchasing, which is impacted by the dollar amount, but also impacted by those definitions of a responsive bid.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:22:15.520
End: 02:22:22.520
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And then also about doing the estimated cost of a project to allow a department head or a consultant.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:22:22.520
End: 02:22:25.520
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: That would be then reflected in that city purchasing resolution.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:22:25.520
End: 02:22:27.520
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: And then we also have many of you familiar with.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:22:27.520
End: 02:22:33.520
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: We have our resolution for architectural engineering services, and also kind of the engineer on call.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:22:33.520
End: 02:22:41.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: If you familiar with some of that in the past, those are also some companion documents, then would reflect the changes that you do in the charter ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 02:22:41.520
End: 02:22:49.520
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So it kind of cascades with the charter ordinance being the initial document that we work from and incorporate everything into our other resolutions.
