End: 00:28:08.560
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: Because of the nuances of the way it was written, it's not actually, it wasn't enforceable that way. So the only way you could enforce patios for the last 10 years that this ordinance has been in place is through that 20 feet from any entrance provision that was in the 2008 ordinance.

City Clerk:
Start: 00:28:08.560
End: 00:28:22.560

City Clerk:
Start: 00:28:22.560

Start: 01:40:40.560
End: 01:40:45.560
Duration: 5.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:40:45.560

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:41:00.560
End: 01:41:08.560
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: But throughout the process, throughout the master plan process, what we heard as known was in favor, really, of opening up the road.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:41:08.560
End: 01:41:16.560
Duration: 8.000 seconds

Start: 01:41:27.560
End: 01:41:39.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:41:39.560
End: 01:41:46.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:41:46.560
End: 01:42:02.560
Duration: 16.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:42:02.560
End: 01:42:09.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:42:09.560
End: 01:42:22.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And the recommendation that the park board gave was to approve the Warner Memorial Park Master Plan, as presented, with the exception of reconsidering, open up the road to the extent of concept B.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:42:22.560
End: 01:42:31.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Now, if you recall, in concept B, and I'll show you kind of what the park board is recommending when I say concept B.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:42:31.560
End: 01:42:45.560
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: When I was here presenting the master plan, options of expanding the road, concept B was the one that was just short of the enhanced shelter.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:42:45.560
End: 01:42:56.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Concept A was looking to extend a little bit further. Now, when city staff went to propose these options, it was more at a higher level.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:42:56.560
End: 01:43:08.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We didn't get into the details as to what each implication would have with each concept.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:43:08.560
End: 01:43:25.560
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: But when park board recommended this latest recommendation that we extend to concept B, we see staff went in and looked a little bit more into detail as to what are the implications with what park board recommended.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:43:25.560
End: 01:43:36.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so those implications would be, there'd be quite a bit of grading. And I want to show you a couple of pictures so we can get an idea of what's happening here in Warner Park.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:43:36.560
End: 01:43:46.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So, this is the existing shelter that is right here, right in the middle. That's the existing shelter right there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:43:47.560
End: 01:43:59.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: These were built back in the 50s, early 60s. And these were some of the shelters that were vandalized quite a bit back in the 80s.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:43:59.560
End: 01:44:06.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: One of the shelters, well, one of the restrooms further north of this area had to actually be removed at that point.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:44:07.560
End: 01:44:17.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So, throughout the conversation at park board, what was discussed was, all right, we want to make the park more accessible to the community.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:44:17.560
End: 01:44:27.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: How do we do that? What's the point of opening the road? Do we go back to the intent from the 1950s and open the road to the full extent?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:44:27.560
End: 01:44:34.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Or do we open it enough to a point that makes sense, so this existing shelter?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:44:35.560
End: 01:44:47.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And so that's where the conversation was, and that's where city staff went back to look at, was what would make sense in opening the road.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:44:47.560
End: 01:44:56.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So, at this point, this is looking to the north from the shelter area. There is a sidewalk there currently.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:44:56.560
End: 01:45:04.560
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: As you get closer to the road, this is the road right here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:04.560
End: 01:45:13.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: This is looking off of the road towards the shelter. It's a little bit secluded. It's in a little co-barrier.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:14.560
End: 01:45:24.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: As we get closer to what the park board is recommending, which is Concept B, you kind of get close to where the cross-country occurs.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:24.560
End: 01:45:33.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And you could lightly see where some of the chalk is. This is where the cross-country route goes through.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:33.560
End: 01:45:39.560
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And so this is that little area where Concept B is recommending the turnaround.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:39.560
End: 01:45:48.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So one of the implications that we look at, if you could tell here, as proposed in Concept B, is there would be quite a bit of re-grading.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:48.560
End: 01:45:59.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: They would have to occur. We'd have to go in with some of the new gravel. We would have to address some of the drainage to be sure to keep that drainage.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:45:59.560
End: 01:46:05.560
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: We'd have to put in a couple of pipes under any kind of roundabout in this area.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:46:06.560
End: 01:46:16.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Not only that, but if you look here, it might be better if I went to this image.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:46:16.560
End: 01:46:25.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So this is where that area right around where B is. It's about 80 to 100 yards from where the shelter is. You can't really see the shelter.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:46:25.560
End: 01:46:46.560
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: So with the direct implementation of the recommendation from Parkport to extend the road to Concept B, we would also want to look at possibly putting in a trail or a sidewalk to access that shelter.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:46:46.560
End: 01:47:05.560
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: And so as you get closer to where that sidewalk is that goes to the shelter, you could see where there's a lot less grade that one would have to deal with in extending it a little bit further than Concept B.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:47:05.560
End: 01:47:13.560
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so that implication would be monetary. We wouldn't have to have a major project have to occur at this point.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:47:13.560
End: 01:47:24.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so in the recommendation that was in your packet, we wanted to show you what is that Parkport recommended.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:47:24.560
End: 01:47:35.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And throughout the discussion, the discussion was, you know, what's the intent? You know, the intent is to make it more accessible, to make the park more accessible, to open it up.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:47:35.560
End: 01:47:45.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I'm sure there will be some comments here in support of closing down the road or leaving it as it was intended in the 1950s.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:47:45.560
End: 01:48:05.560
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: Throughout the discussion at Parkport, it was also discussed, you know, is there a way that we could test opening the road? Is there a way that we could implement this?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:48:05.560
End: 01:48:14.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Well, there would be, and the easiest one would be if we went tomorrow and just opened up the gate. And it would be in use as it was intended in the 1950s.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:48:14.560
End: 01:48:31.560
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: However, there's also implications with that. Because then if we open up the road, how do we keep people on the road? And so right now, where the existing parking lot is, there's quite a bit of limestone around the border. And that's to keep people out of the park.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:48:31.560
End: 01:48:42.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Because that was one of the other things that occurred back in the 80s and such. People were going out there, and they're four by four is doing donuts and really tearing up the prairie.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:48:42.560
End: 01:49:00.560
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So with any of these options of opening up the road, we would need to consider how do we keep people on the road? Whether it's through limestone boulders, which is something that could be done with in-house labor.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:49:00.560
End: 01:49:15.560
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: I know sometimes we get projects where we could get some limestone boulders, but if this was something that wanted to get implemented right away, we would have to purchase those. So those would be a material expense.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:49:15.560
End: 01:49:27.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Another consideration would be, is there a way, and this was a discussion at the park board as well, was there a way, can we do some sort of gate mechanism?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:49:27.560
End: 01:49:38.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Can the gate be opened during the day and then closed at night? In internal conversations with staff that would be fairly hard operationally.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:49:38.560
End: 01:49:54.560
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: We don't have any other park that we close. The gate at night, Annaberg is open, night and day. But we do have within our park system, you know, a six a.m. to 11 p.m. open timeframe.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:

Text: If anybody is in the park, with their vehicle over past 11, they could get ticketed for trespassing. So that would be an implication for this option, and really with any option opening the road, is that gate mechanism.

Speaker_2:

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:51:02.560
End: 01:51:17.560

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:51:17.560

Start: 01:51:29.560

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:51:38.560
End: 01:51:58.560
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: However, once we had, once we discussed internally, you know, what's the point of opening the road? We want to make more accessible. We want to get people somewhere, and that would be the shelter, and what would make most sense, and that would be, and the more cost effective.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:51:58.560
End: 01:52:11.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: It's something that's not as disruptive to the drainage and to the grading, and that would be to put in parking just to the, to the north of the shelter, kind of there in the picture where I had my car.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:52:11.560
End: 01:52:24.560

Text: It's relatively flat. We would go in there, scrape out, you know, 20 by 50 area for maybe about five vehicles, and a little turnaround that in that area as well.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:52:24.560
End: 01:52:36.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So with this option as well, you know, if we open up the road, how do we keep people on the road? And again, those would be some of the same measures, so limestone, some sort of metal fencing, maybe some posts and wires.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:52:36.560
End: 01:52:46.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I'm not sure if anyone's familiar with Marlatt Park, just north of town. They have parking areas there, and they have posts and wire, and you'll have to keep people out of the park.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:52:46.560
End: 01:52:57.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So maybe it's something that we could do similar there as well. And it wouldn't have to be throughout the whole road. There are areas where the ditch does go down quite a bit.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:52:57.560
End: 01:53:04.560

Start: 01:53:31.560

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:44:11.740

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:44:36.740
End: 02:44:47.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:45:08.740

Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:01.740
End: 02:46:08.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: If they've been a first time renter or as you see a majority of them there had rented three or more times to give us some feedback.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:08.740
End: 02:46:15.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:15.740
End: 02:46:24.740
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:24.740
End: 02:46:32.740
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: We did find out that no one said that they're utilizing the city of Manhattan's risk reduction website of information.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:32.740
End: 02:46:37.740

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:37.740
End: 02:46:45.740
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And then they also said kind of considering our people just looking at one unit and taking it or they're looking at multiple units kind of what is their due diligence as they're doing their process.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:45.740
End: 02:46:54.740
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And as you see several of them at least for 38 of the respondents looked at four more of the units and before they selected their final one.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:46:54.740
End: 02:47:01.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Here's the number one concern. We talked about what is a decision factor that goes into the renters in Manhattan from the sample.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:01.740
End: 02:47:08.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And so price matters. Price was a number one issue as to how people found their housing in Manhattan for this group.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:08.740
End: 02:47:15.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Then also you look at the second one was overall condition. They kind of made an assessment. Is this the overall condition I want to live in?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:15.740
End: 02:47:21.740
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: We asked a simple question. Do you read your lease agreement? And 89% of the respondents said yes they do.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:21.740
End: 02:47:29.740
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So it was important to make sure that people are understanding how they go in to the tenant landlord relationship with the lease being the basis of that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:30.740
End: 02:47:38.740
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Also we asked if they do a walkthrough and are things documented when they go through the walkthrough. And so some said yes and is documented 60%.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:38.740
End: 02:47:45.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: They said yes but it was not documented for 12% of those and then know the 28 of the respondents.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:45.740
End: 02:47:58.740
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: What we also found out and this was in a headline after the form in the Manhattan Mercury where the respondents of these renters said they did not know that the city had a rental inspection service or that you could call and require or ask a free.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:47:58.740
End: 02:48:05.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So that was an eye opening I think for me and for some of the students there and other renters.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:48:05.740
End: 02:48:14.740
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Then we kind of went into how do they view the unit that they currently live in. 75% of them that they are extremely or somewhat satisfied.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:48:14.740
End: 02:48:23.740
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And there are also 11 respondents or 8% that were extremely dissatisfied. So you kind of get a sense of people generally like the unit that they are in.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:48:23.740
End: 02:48:32.740
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And then we said well do you feel safe in your unit and so do you feel your current rental unit is unsafe?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:48:32.740
End: 02:48:38.740
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Is the key question unsafe to live in and 85% said no it's not unsafe.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:48:38.740
End: 02:48:46.740
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And then we looked at code violations. So have they ever felt uncomfortable calling the code enforcement office or submitting a service request to landlord.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:48:46.740
End: 02:48:58.740
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And so 83% said no they did not feel uncomfortable. And so I think that's a good sign that people in our community are willing to speak up if they have some issues with their property.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:48:58.740
End: 02:49:05.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And then the issue that we have in Manhattan about the four more unrelated occupants and dwelling.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:49:05.740
End: 02:49:13.740
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: We want to fair that out a little bit more so we ask have you ever been willing to ignore some poor rental conditions in order to have more roommates not list on the lease.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:49:13.740
End: 02:49:26.740
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And so we found that 89% said no 11% said yes. But also we did not isolate the students versus the faculty staff who did that response.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:49:26.740
End: 02:49:32.740
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then we talked about the communication what would prohibit you from raising any housing concerns with your landlord.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:49:32.740
End: 02:49:38.740
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And really you see the high rate 367 said nothing would prohibit them from raising some issues.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:49:38.740
End: 02:49:45.740
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: There was a fear of landlord retaliation eviction we've heard that concern in the community. We don't know how anecdotal that is but we have a bit more information.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:49:45.740
End: 02:49:51.740
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then one fear was they'd have to move if they raised a concern with their unit.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:49:52.740
End: 02:50:03.740
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:50:22.740

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:52:34.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:53:49.740
End: 02:53:56.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:53:56.740
End: 02:54:00.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:54:00.740
End: 02:54:12.740
Duration: 12.000 seconds

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:54:12.740

City Clerk:
Start: 02:54:19.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:54:34.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:54:37.740
End: 02:54:47.740
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And then we ask again so this was on the flip side we asked about the renters and if they went through and did a walkthrough we asked the landlords and they said yes they do a walkthrough.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:54:47.740
End: 02:54:50.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:54:58.740
End: 02:55:09.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:55:09.740
End: 02:55:17.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:55:25.740

Speaker_4:
Start: 02:55:34.740
End: 02:55:39.740

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:56:11.740

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:56:16.740
End: 02:56:21.740
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_4:
Start: 02:56:21.740
End: 02:56:25.740
