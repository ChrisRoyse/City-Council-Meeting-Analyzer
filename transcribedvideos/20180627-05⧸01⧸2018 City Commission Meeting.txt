Start: 01:25:05.580

Mayor Morse:
Start: 01:25:31.580

Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: It did impact our vote. And I think maybe those discussions are important. I don't know how we would address such. What I what I don't want to do is be so protective of how long people are speaking or what they're saying, not so much what they're saying, but so protective of time.

Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: I think the concern. I understand what you're saying, Commissioner. I think I think the reason one of the reasons for the policy is just so we're treating people equally. So may or more, if someone gets up here and she doesn't agree with what they're saying. So they're out here for they've been going on for 10 minutes. And she says, well, that's enough. Let's let's move on.

Commissioner Dodson:

Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: But if the next guy comes up and that's the friend who's up here saying the positive things, she let's them go on for 20 minutes. Well, we violated the rights of that person who just spoke for 10 minutes. That's the purpose of the time frame. And I think if you can't, you know, five minutes is not brevity. Like you can if you've reached a consensus of a group, you should be able to explain the process and the outcomes and what you're trying to do.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Dodson:
Start: 01:27:49.580

Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Let me add, there's a couple things that the policy allows to do. You're concerned. First, an individual can still bring a presentation and that individual would have five minutes to present it. So that that opportunity is still there.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morse:
Start: 01:28:12.580
End: 01:28:25.580
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Because we've created this optional sign up in advance where you can speak in a certain order. So we're giving preference to people. There's nothing to preclude four people from signing up one after another and each presenting five minutes of a presentation.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morse:
Start: 01:28:25.580
End: 01:28:38.580
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: As long as the each individual is stuck to five minutes. So so there's an opportunity to accomplish what you're wanting if a group is passionate and wants to deliver in that way. There's a mechanism for them to do that under this policy.

Mayor Morse:
Start: 01:28:38.580
End: 01:28:53.580

Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And you're right. They can't step up and do it. But that's something we need to inform the public about. Here are your options. If you are an organization and I want us to be clear on how we inform the public.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morse:
Start: 01:29:20.580
End: 01:29:35.580
Duration: 15.000 seconds
