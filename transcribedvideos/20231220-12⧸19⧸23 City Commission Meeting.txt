If anybody is generating more sales tax or any sales tax whatsoever in the Aggieville Tiff, those continue to come straight to the city and they're not part of what the state would separate and send to us as a tip revenue.

Text: Again, these were estimates that were put together from the developer and their team. When they looked at revenue streams 2038, 2023 through 2038, most of them starting in 2026 were looking at that phase one retail taxable sales, phase two hotel, those taxable sales, that total taxable.

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:12:08.000
End: 00:12:28.000

Text: And then the sales tax that would be generated from those sales, you've got the transient gas tax roughly at 7.5% of their anticipated taxable sales generating anywhere from 168,000 in the first year through 419.

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:12:28.000

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:13:49.000

Start: 00:14:04.000
