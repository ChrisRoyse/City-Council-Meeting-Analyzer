Speaker_0:
Start: 00:49:54.000

Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: We touched base and presented previously last year and we do have some updates.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:50:00.000
End: 00:50:21.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: So this initial graphic exhibit outlines the area of interest that we examine previously, which is 12th Street between larmy and morrow as well as larmy street to the south, 12th Street south of larmy, 11th Street between larmy and the alleys.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:50:21.000
End: 00:50:32.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And then we are looking at concepts for the alleys between 11th Street and North Manhattan.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:50:32.000
End: 00:50:43.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So we'll go through three concepts briefly for 12th Street between larmy and morrow on all three of these plans, north is to the right.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:50:43.000
End: 00:51:04.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: So one idea that we've been looking at, particularly with this one in the next is bringing 12th Street down to one lane of traffic, flowing to the south towards larmy street with no parking at all provided on that street.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:51:04.000
End: 00:51:11.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: We've had a lot of discussions with city staff and fire marshal regarding safety and access.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:51:11.000
End: 00:51:25.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So what we're proposing is really something aesthetically that matches the improvements that have already been completed and speak very nicely to the improvements on 12th Street, next to tanners and takah lucha.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:51:25.000
End: 00:51:42.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So we're going to bring that design language to the south and create a very pedestrian friendly space that could act as momentum for festival street through decorative lighting and street furniture and things like that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:51:42.000
End: 00:51:52.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: On this particular first concept, we have looked at removing or creating a flush curb scenario on this thoroughfare.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:51:52.000
End: 00:52:11.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So traffic would again flowing to the south towards larmy street, no curb, the ability to close off with removable ballards, the street for special events at morrow as well as block the alley headed to the west or from the west there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:52:11.000
End: 00:52:29.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And then additional removable ballards located at larmy street. In this scenario, we would propose a central drain system. So all of it's an inverse crown where all of the water flow would head towards the center of the street and then be drained out of there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:52:30.000
End: 00:52:43.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: For fire access, we have a little bit wider street between morrow and the alley that's shown at 26 feet wide and would allow for the outriggers for fire trucks and safety measures.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:52:43.000
End: 00:52:57.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Whereas then from the alley south to larmy, the road actually narrows down to 15 street or 15 feet and allows more pedestrian access and movement on the sidewalk space.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:52:57.000
End: 00:53:14.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And that also allows for more amenities like plantings and trees. What we're showing is again something similar to what is already created over by Takalucha with the overhead umbrellas that we see here shown plan south around the east side.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:53:15.000
End: 00:53:30.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And then what we've done is we've opened up the experience with less shade structures and more trees as we're looking plan north or west towards the midtown development and any sort of activities that would be happening there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:53:30.000
End: 00:53:43.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: We really envision with this street closed off and speaking with the owners of the midtown development and working with things that they may be doing that interaction there and providing an open view corridor.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:53:44.000
End: 00:53:49.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And that was important on to concept two.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:53:49.000
End: 00:53:58.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So this one takes cues as well from the design language that has already been established with the cadence and rhythm of these decorative bands.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:53:58.000
End: 00:54:07.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: This concept as well also incorporates singular lane of traffic, north south to larmy flush curb scenario.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:54:07.000
End: 00:54:19.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So again it has that 26 foot wide segment between Moro and the alley and then it narrows up to that 15 foot wide scenario that we previously looked at.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:54:19.000
End: 00:54:28.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: One thing that differentiates this one from the previous concept that we looked at though was the incorporation of a different variety of seating.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:54:28.000
End: 00:54:42.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So this particular concept brings in more of those limestone block features and creates a lot more variety of seating again opening up view sheds towards the midtown development.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:54:42.000
End: 00:54:50.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And then we also looked at polling pedestrian traffic a little bit further away from the hotel and the hotel experience.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:54:50.000
End: 00:55:09.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Give them just a little bit of buffer and then we've got our pedestrian realm on all of these concepts to we looked at utilizing landscape and landscape features to limit air and cars protect corners of buildings.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:55:09.000
End: 00:55:29.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: So this is being very mindful of turning radius of vehicles as they when they do need to access the alley or if a car maybe were to veer off of larmy street providing some sort of protection zone to prevent damage to these new buildings.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:55:29.000
End: 00:55:42.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: One we also were proposing decorative lighting in the form of catenary lights between the alley and larmy and really sets the tone as what we would imagine is this very exciting festival street.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 00:55:42.000
End: 00:55:45.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:55:45.000
End: 00:55:59.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So those are consisting of a pole and then typically a string a stainless steel or some sort of wire system that would then hold what we have shown here as a singular light.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:55:59.000
End: 00:56:04.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds

Speaker_0:
Start: 00:56:42.000
End: 00:56:53.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:56:53.000
End: 00:56:56.000

Speaker_0:
Start: 00:57:01.000

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:57:08.000
End: 00:57:22.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: But by removing the curb and making it a flush scenario, it really opens up the possibility for when we do shut down streets having better human pedestrian circulation and preventing traffic.

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:57:55.000
End: 00:58:04.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:58:04.000
End: 00:58:13.000

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:58:13.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 00:58:21.000
End: 00:58:28.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 00:58:28.000
End: 00:58:31.000

Speaker_0:
Start: 00:58:57.000
End: 00:59:16.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:59:16.000
End: 00:59:38.000
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: Again, carrying through design language in terms of geometric form and features, the material, but then transitioning to a little bit more vibrant feel in the ground plane as well as allowing for unique spaces that the other two concepts don't provide.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 00:59:38.000
End: 00:59:52.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds

Start: 00:59:57.000
End: 01:00:26.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So update on Laramie streets. Here we are looking at a road re-alignment and shifting of Laramie specifically around the midtown development and the hotel, shifting the road to the south and providing one way traffic to the west from 11th towards North Manhattan and reclaiming some of that extra real estate to give back to the pedestrian realm and also create a new way to the south.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:00:26.000
End: 01:00:55.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: We've cut through a couple of sections here to better illustrate how this would feel and work. Again, working with the Fire Marshal and their requirements for specific widths for their outriggers.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:00:55.000
End: 01:01:09.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: We have these different zones delineated with through traffic. So for example, section cut A is right through here, cutting through the hotel and then looking east.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:01:09.000
End: 01:01:24.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: We've got our unrestricted pedestrian zone which is a sidewalk that could have permanent features like planters or benches or site amenities.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:01:24.000
End: 01:01:31.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: We then have our amenity zone which would have lighting and then in this particular instance we have a drop off zone.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:01:31.000
End: 01:01:54.000
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So this band of gray on the north side of the street is really a transitional zone that is dedicated primarily for pedestrian use but at strategic locations is also utilized as a drop off zone.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:01:54.000
End: 01:02:13.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So this car right here is shown as a ride share pickup on a Saturday night right at this location. So what we've done is we've delineated what that drop off zone would look like through fixed large planters on either side.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:02:13.000
End: 01:02:29.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So we're envisioning some sort of ride share pickup drop off zone loading zone at this location here as well as on the west side of 12th by the midtown development.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:02:29.000
End: 01:02:40.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So the pickup cut B then is a little bit further down and again it shows that larger pedestrian zone. There is no drop off pickup in this location.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:02:40.000
End: 01:02:56.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: We've got this transitional zone that is really intended for the pedestrian user but if a fire truck or an emergency were to happen there is unimpeded access for them to utilize that zone.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:02:56.000
End: 01:03:09.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And then we do have strategic locations both here on the west side as well as a few on the east side we've provided a few on street parallel parking stalls.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 01:03:09.000
End: 01:03:22.000

Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 01:33:21.000

Text: There the other thing is are totally self contained which means you have no water leaking out of it if you've got whatever cans are thrown in there half full whatever you're sat whatever is done there's there is not going to be a leaking mess down below so that's what's that's what's nice about a compactor so getting trash to the compactor what we needed to do is try to get it in the middle as much as what we can.

Text: So in this area we can the enclosure will be similar it was still haven't really nailed that down is going to be similar to what we did on little moral on that trash because that what that is designed for a compactor as well for the future so the other thing is we we really would probably try and figure out how to get a recycle dumpster in there too for recycle for car.

Text: This is the this is the the hotel they're labeled we probably should have thrown the drawing on there kind of showing what it looks like but and then this is the parking garage we have a notch cut out of the parking garage that it will go in the parking garage and it will be included into the parking garage development.

Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 01:36:28.000
End: 01:36:57.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: Just so it is and it's the second level is is going to it's the first levels going away and so it'll be up we have the third level so they can get the height so there'll be no parking above this it's a bigger area than what we really need but we needed to be able to get a truck squared away in the right angle so it works really well in that location and it's more centrally located within the mid mid block of the.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 01:36:58.000
End: 01:37:27.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: This one here is was a little bit of a not much area to go you got the other hotel within this block no place to square up and this is about the only place that will work and then there again you know we got overhead power that we have yet to check and double check on this but it works with the truck it may have to move.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 01:37:28.000
End: 01:37:57.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So we have to move over a little more in order to make that work to get it clear because this block is not going to have the power underground with this phase of the project so the the other block between 11th and 12th which would be the talk of Lucia outly we're not doing any consolidated trash with that knowing that that would happen probably happen when that block on the north half would get redoed.

Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 01:37:58.000
End: 01:38:14.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So that's pretty developed and it'd be incorporated into that same distance with that alley it's a it's pretty well filled up it's kind of hard to get a trash compact or located in that area to get get picked up so that one will we'll have to wait.

Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 01:38:14.000

Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: That's pretty basic on the trash I guess I think I don't remember who asked about how you get trash to these areas and I think that's something that needs to be discussed I've seen a lot of I've seen a lot of trash being hauled out in sacks and dripping all the way to the dumpsters there's got to be a way that that is fixed so we don't have that as trails going down.

Commissioner Adam Chak:
Start: 01:38:44.000

Text: If the trash bags leak on the way there so we still got to work that out I think the one that that's out there by triangle park you know looks pretty good I mean I know we don't have a compactor in it but it's designed for that and you know expanding that concept I think it's worthwhile.
