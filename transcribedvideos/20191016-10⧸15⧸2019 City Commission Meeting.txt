City Attorney:
Start: 01:13:31.340
End: 01:13:42.340
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:14:17.340
End: 01:14:27.340
Duration: 10.000 seconds

City Attorney:
Start: 01:14:27.340

--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:14:34.340
End: 01:14:38.340

--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:14:38.340
End: 01:14:50.340
Duration: 12.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:14:50.340
End: 01:14:57.340
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:14:57.340
End: 01:15:15.340
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: The other thing it does, which it can also compromise a criminal prosecution because the second way in which an ordinance can be challenged, is somebody violates the ordinance, the police department rights, a citation, the city of Manhattan Municipal Court prosecutes that violation.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:15:15.340
End: 01:15:23.340
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And during that process, the defendant challenges files a motion to dismiss challenging the ordinance as unconstitutional.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:15:23.340
End: 01:15:37.340
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: That would go through the state court system and the city prosecutors would be arguing that constitutionality issue as far as the case got appealed, which would depend upon that defendant and how far they want to take it if they, if we were successful.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:15:37.340
End: 01:15:52.340
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So what it does is it gives someone a really good case to argue against the city of Manhattan. And so we thought it was important to bring it to you because it does create a risk of the use of city funds or resources to defend this ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 01:15:52.340
End: 01:16:02.340
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And the other thing I want to say on that is we're in a unique position here in the city of Manhattan because we have two police departments that enforce our ordinances.

Text: Well, in terms of a display of public nudity. Yeah. So if we don't, if our ordinance continues the way it's written now, then if somebody that applies within the public pools, if that ordinance is repealed, we're not going to layer on a gendered regulation on top of the public pools.

Text: That's contrary to what our ordinance says because those things would be in conflict. So to go to your example, to public pools or the splash park. Again, if let me go back. If the display of nudity involved, any of the body parts except the female breasts, that would still be prosecuted by the city of Manhattan as the violation of our public nudity ordinance, general display.

City Attorney:
Start: 01:30:07.340
