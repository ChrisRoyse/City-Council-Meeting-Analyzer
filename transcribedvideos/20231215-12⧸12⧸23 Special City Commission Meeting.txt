End: 00:06:22.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: To comment on your question though, I just want to say that I wouldn't say it's blackmail because if we do not perform and our project does not perform, we do not see any of that money.

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:06:22.000
End: 00:06:25.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:06:25.000
End: 00:06:42.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So if we don't put the money up front into the project and build the buildings, the buildings do not produce the revenue in which we are going to be requesting that gets reimbursed to us up until I think the final payment will be made in 2039 after the TIF expires in 2038.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:06:43.000
End: 00:06:56.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But that is all information we can discuss next Tuesday potentially without the TIF being amended to include TGT and to include sales tax.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:06:56.000
End: 00:07:05.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: There won't be a presentation next Tuesday because we will not have the ability to even go before the commission and make that request.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:07:05.000
End: 00:07:13.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So today all we are doing is amending it. It simply doesn't mean that anybody is committing any of those funds to anything at this point in time.
--------------------------------------------------

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:09:50.000
End: 00:10:00.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:10:00.000
End: 00:10:11.000

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:10:11.000
End: 00:10:19.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:10:19.000
End: 00:10:28.000

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:12:24.000
End: 00:12:34.000

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:12:38.000

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:12:44.000
End: 00:12:52.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:12:52.000

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:13:12.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:13:22.000
End: 00:13:31.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:13:31.000
End: 00:13:39.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: The next one is government competition. This one kind of involves two items that have evolved over the last couple of sessions.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:13:39.000
End: 00:13:46.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So we saw this come up a couple years ago and it was more industry specific exemptions guaranteed by the state.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:13:46.000
End: 00:13:54.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So that was for gyms. That was and if you were a fitness facility were they were advocating for property tax exemption.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:13:54.000
End: 00:14:02.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: The last session it kind of evolved more into entities deemed to be considered in competition with local governments.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:14:02.000
End: 00:14:13.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: It was a very broad bill. It didn't have any specifics on what would be considered in competition. Is that a golf course? Is that a city concession stand? Is that one of our rec centers?
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:14:13.000
End: 00:14:26.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:14:26.000
End: 00:14:43.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And then the third one we've had this on our program as well but property valuation caps just advocating for uniform valuation and in communities like Manhattan where sales happen fairly regularly.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:14:43.000
End: 00:14:53.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:15:00.000
End: 00:15:08.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:15:08.000
End: 00:15:22.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So this is why we added it to the program but essentially what the bill did was aiming to eliminate the city's ability to apply planning zoning or subdivision regulations within that three mile boundary of their city limits.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:15:22.000
End: 00:15:35.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The reason we want to maintain that is that is essential for growth management if you're going to annex those parts of other communities you want to make sure that they're built to those same standards and protecting safety of those communities.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:15:35.000
End: 00:15:46.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So I talked with community development currently right now Manhattan does have interlocal agreements with our neighboring communities they do different things.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:15:46.000
End: 00:15:54.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So this doesn't necessarily impact Manhattan today but we are still advocating for this because there is potential that it could in the future.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:15:54.000
End: 00:16:05.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So our interlocal agreement with Riley County does apply to subdivision regulations so we're covered there the county is using the city subdivision regulations.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:16:05.000
End: 00:16:14.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: For Potawatomi County our interlocal agreement applies to building codes but not subdivision regulations.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:16:14.000
End: 00:16:30.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And Stephanie did say that pot county does have subdivision regulations that are similar to what ours were prior to MDC so we're not currently using ours but that's kind of like the loophole right there and then both Riley and Potawatomi County have zoning.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:16:30.000
End: 00:16:43.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So that's not something that we're concerned about so this is really just a preemptive advocating for communities across Kansas but in the event that if this did go to an end to effect it could impact Potawatomi County from a subdivision.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:16:43.000
End: 00:16:51.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:17:12.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 00:17:21.000
End: 00:17:38.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: I did want to note that the funding of this was proposed in the 2022 session but it did die in committee so it keeps kind of coming back up but we haven't seen any committed funding to that from the state so we still have that on our list because that helps the property tax burden.
