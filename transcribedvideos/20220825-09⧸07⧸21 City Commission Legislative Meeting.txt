Text: I can't hear my phone on this after listening to what Vern had to say we've got an art board. It really never had any funding. So I could, does this policy support the idea of like the arts board coming up with an idea, community based from everyone and then them asking the community foundation for money.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 02:17:30.000
End: 02:17:40.000

Text: And then the applicant would be the art sport if they got the money from the community foundation. And then we could run it to the system. Is that workable in this type of environment?

Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: That might be something that needs to be worked a little bit more as to, I mean, typically that board isn't an advocate. I would think part of that would be them is the city going to be an applicant for one of our facilities or a park or a land or is there a reasonable sponsor for that.
--------------------------------------------------
Staff Member:
Start: 02:18:05.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 02:18:18.000

Text: They're going to have to have an application sent to them and I guess the arts board. If you don't agree, let us know. But but I could see that working and there's your source of funding because the big hole on that's always been you didn't have a funding source.
