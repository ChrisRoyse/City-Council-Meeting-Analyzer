--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:04:23.360
End: 00:04:31.360
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:04:31.360
End: 00:04:38.360
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Not saying that we leave all 20 open or empty but I think maybe we could have reduced to or three to avoid a mill levy increase.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:04:38.360
End: 00:04:46.360
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Also the last comment kind of to do with the budget that I hope next year that we have a little bit of a closer look at is the step increase.

Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:04:46.360
End: 00:04:54.360
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: I am all for making sure that city employees get their call increases year to year and I'm all for making sure city employees are making a livable wage.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:04:54.360
End: 00:04:59.360
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:04:59.360
End: 00:05:07.360
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: But I would much rather see that step increase be a merit increase to where if you do a above satisfactory job you deserve a raise.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:05:07.360
End: 00:05:13.360
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: But if you are here for a year you shouldn't just get a raise because you're here for a year.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:05:13.360
End: 00:05:22.360
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So I hope next year we're able to evaluate the step increases a little bit closer because I would much much rather see those be based on merit rather than just a year of tenure.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:05:22.360
End: 00:05:27.360
Duration: 5.000 seconds

Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:05:29.360
End: 00:05:43.360
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Yeah just to follow on on what commissioner McKee said I also voted against the city budget and I'm going to do that again because I think some of the suggestions that commissioner McKee had we should probably have investigated that.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:05:43.360
End: 00:05:58.360
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: They may have some look but my primarily concern was not so much the work city staff did I think Ron and the city staff worked real hard towards my concepts of lean management and cut as much waste out of it as possible.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:05:58.360
End: 00:06:12.360
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: But I don't think the city commission cut as much waste as possible and particularly two things that I've harped on that they're probably tired of me mentioning it but outside agencies my goal was to keep the out later that to one mill and we exceeded that.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:06:12.360
End: 00:06:20.360
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And then our travel expenses which which we keep exceeding also we put them in the budget and we bust them every year and to me that's just crazy.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:06:20.360
End: 00:06:25.360
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And so I can't support that but I do appreciate the work that the staff did on that.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:06:25.360
End: 00:06:32.360
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And then there's one other item that's sort of related to that and that's item M on here which is the habitat for humanity.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:06:32.360
End: 00:06:43.360
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And that's to wave some sewer connection fees and some building fees and I'm not going to support that simply because you know the city manager is busy trying to scramble to make the two 18th budget work.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:06:43.360
End: 00:06:55.360
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And this also falls in the category of outside agencies and we've already given away $575,000 plus and we just keep adding to it adding to it and that makes his job harder.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:06:55.360
End: 00:07:09.360
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And I understand the value of that you know project and I get it it makes the house more affordable but if we waive the building fees and the meter hook up fees for every house in the city it would make them all more affordable.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:07:09.360
End: 00:07:13.360
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: So I'm not going to support that either.

Start: 00:08:47.360
End: 00:08:59.360

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:09:11.360

End: 00:16:43.360
Duration: 17.000 seconds

Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:19:03.360
End: 00:19:15.360
Duration: 12.000 seconds

Start: 00:19:15.360
End: 00:19:27.360

Mayor Morris:
Start: 00:19:27.360
End: 00:19:38.360
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Text: That throughout the process has been very well received by the community in terms of the overall vision for what we anticipate developing the park to be. So most of the park remains natural. There's only nine acres of what we call developed area and the majority of that as we believe as Tim and Angie wished was a natural prairie area that people could enjoy within the city.

End: 00:32:20.360
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: It is still a significant project and it's not going to happen overnight but somewhere between 2.4 and 3.4 million dollars for total development the early phases are smaller and we think that they can be managed some of them with money that's budgeted in 2018 and 2019 CIPs for at least creating that initial access ability and then over time we think we could develop additional trails.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:32:21.360
End: 00:32:50.360
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So we're going to grant another funding sources as well as city CIP to develop those other amenities over time. The phasing is a suggestion once we get into actual project details and implementation through that budgeting process we we refine those budget numbers we refine the scope of those work of each phase but I think that this provides a general road map for for the department for the city moving forward phase we're calling it phase zero.

Text: So this is the prairie restoration and management phase which is more of an ongoing process in terms of how we manage the parkland but we thought it's important to list this first because it really is key to the overall enjoyment of the community using that space if we allow the land to if we lose the prairie resource to red cedar or other invasives we've lost really what the community was interested in in terms of being able to access and enjoy and use that area.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:33:19.360
End: 00:33:48.360
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So prairie restoration is a critical component and we talk about the details of that in chapter eight but we would envision that as the first and ongoing process to really reclaim portions of that of that native landscape and then the first official phase I guess phase one a and B phase one a construct the Loma Ridge entrance provides some rough grading and basic trail act parking basic parking and basic trail access through that portion of the park which was an attempt to be able to access the park.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:33:48.360
End: 00:34:16.360
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: So that was a very important part of the park which was an attempt to make it that area more usable for folks on the on the immediate and then phase one B focuses on both the Miller Rant Miller Parkway south side and taking what's left of the rock pile that's on the south side moving it to the north side to as fill material and then final grading both the north and the south side and seating to make both of those areas usable open spaces.

Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:34:16.360

Commissioner Morris:
Start: 00:34:58.360

Mayor Morris:

End: 01:00:56.360

End: 01:01:30.360
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: One more question about the insurance. If the commission said we want to do all six of these things, that obviously requires more time of city staff. So in the example of the Bluemont project, costing $70,000, would you have to equate the city staff time into the total cost of the project?
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 01:01:30.360
End: 01:01:50.360
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: For the purposes of the statutory bond? No, that's not necessary. There's obviously a cost there. But technically, the cost that that bond is looking for is the cost to provide the person doing work rather than the inherent cost in the city.

End: 01:03:30.360

Mayor Morris:
Start: 01:03:30.360
End: 01:03:42.360

Duration: 18.000 seconds

And then after about a page in, I thought to myself, I can't afford to go to law school. But if we keep getting packets written like this, I might have to start saving up because it's incredibly complicated.

Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:48:13.960

Mayor Morris:
Start: 01:49:55.960
End: 01:50:09.960
Duration: 14.000 seconds

Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:50:09.960

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Morris:
Start: 01:50:34.960
End: 01:50:54.960
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: If they add a zero or some discounted price, if they don't complete the project, our contract is going to make payments out as things are completed. If it doesn't get completed, we're going to get out of that contract and contract with somebody else and use the balance of the funds.

Mayor Morris:
Start: 01:51:10.960
End: 01:51:22.960

Mayor Morris:
Start: 01:53:38.960

Duration: 15.000 seconds

Mayor Morris:
Start: 01:53:53.960

Start: 01:54:05.960
End: 01:54:20.960
