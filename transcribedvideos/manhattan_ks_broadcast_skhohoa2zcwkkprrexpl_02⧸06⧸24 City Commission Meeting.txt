End: 00:45:10.200
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: hopefully before closing, but certainly at that time, is it is there the potential for further special assessments included in that or just or is it just because, you know, we've got like some storm run projects and stuff like that that maybe we weren't we're not anticipated when the development was made.

City Manager:
Start: 00:45:10.200

Start: 00:45:55.200

City Manager:

End: 00:46:49.200
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: And so we issue our temporary notes for up to about three and a half years. So there's just a lag sometimes in terms of when the special assessments actually go on the property compared to when the property owner purchases and that timeline of communication and then depending on when they actually bought the property and when the petitions were submitted, then there could be some communication breakdown or timeline.

City Manager:

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:49:18.100

Text: Well didn't you say we could do a contract with a high capacity user that could be specific to them.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:49:25.100
End: 01:49:31.100
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So if he's a high capacity you know we could either give him a discounted or no rate because he's connected.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:49:31.100
End: 01:49:41.100
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: He's a high capacity user and we sign a deal with them that says that you can only do no rate if there was a public purpose served and you offered the same no rate to similar requesting parties.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:49:41.100
End: 01:49:46.100
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: But you can do a discounted rate like a bulk rate that's pretty common with high capacity users.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:49:46.100
End: 01:49:53.100
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: But in terms of free that's different because you're basically exempting one private party unless you're going to offer it to other similar parties and that you can describe.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:49:53.100
End: 01:49:57.100

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:50:07.100

Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So so potentially you're undermining your revenue and depends on how we write it.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:50:15.100
End: 01:50:26.100
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: But there's just two different things that you're describing and I don't want you to be misled as to what we bring back in terms of it can't say one user is exempt from a fee.

Mayor Butler:

Text: It's a case of like if he has a conference come in they may stay in four hotels down there and as long as Adrian could give him a promo code now who pays for that good good question.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:50:42.100
End: 01:50:49.100
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Adrian Tucker, Parking Services Manager:
Start: 01:50:56.100
End: 01:51:08.100
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So if we're saying that however it happens conference center guests don't actually pay for the parking we need to figure out how to make up that loss.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:

Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: I find it hard to believe that if you have a conference with a hundred people attending that they're going to withdraw from a contract or cancel that's going to be a tie breaker or a deal breaker.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:51:26.100
End: 01:51:34.100
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:51:34.100

Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: You know if I was running a hotel this is what I think they do in other cities where it looks like it free parking I sign up for a conference and it cost me $110.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:51:54.100
End: 01:51:58.100
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:51:58.100
End: 01:52:07.100
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And it's just not it's just not visible and that's how the code could work and so I don't really see the issue you know the whoever sets up the conference rates.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:52:07.100
End: 01:52:20.100
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: You know unless there are really preset you know you can absorb the cost and that's sort of the way I'm looking at it and you know it sounds like the Hilton's already charging $10 for parking so what's the issue.
--------------------------------------------------
Adrian Tucker, Parking Services Manager:
Start: 01:52:20.100
End: 01:52:30.100

Text: And it can be done I did hotel I did hotel parking for conferences and valley parking for six years it can be done.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:52:30.100
End: 01:52:42.100
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So I think we're all sort of an agreement we'd like to we don't want to damage anybody's business down there but of course we want to be legal about it so is that good enough.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:52:42.100
End: 01:52:56.100
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So what we would do is come back with the draft resolution a fee resolution for the downtown garage that would address that structure at the same time.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:52:56.100
End: 01:53:14.100
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Well what we could do though what we want to do now is come back with a contract with IPS because it seems like there's an clear majority of the city commission that wants to enforce with license play recognition and establish some fee structure.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:53:14.100
End: 01:53:32.100
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So we would come back at a meeting probably the next meeting with a that contract to purchase that equipment with IPS that takes some time to purchase install that equipment and then surely thereafter we're coming back with that fee resolution.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:53:32.100
End: 01:53:44.100
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We can work out the I think maybe the fee resolution should be a discussion item initially and then get feedback we can do that yeah we can finalize it.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:53:44.100
End: 01:53:59.100
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Yeah I would just add that you know most people who are coming to conferences are receiving some reimbursement from their employer from their professional organization and frequently people get paid for or could be reimbursed for parking.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:53:59.100
End: 01:54:13.100
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: It's a legitimate expense and you know so it's not as if we're putting a $5 burden on people who carpool to a conference with four people in the vehicle.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:54:13.100
End: 01:54:19.100

Text: Is there before we shift from downtown is there any feedback related to the Aggieville rates that Adrian talked about we've been through one year of Aggieville's rate structure and we've described that is there any comments or thoughts or feedback on the commit or the city changing that.

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:54:39.100
End: 01:55:08.100
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I just like to just continue what we're doing I think you know the Aggieville business associations happy with it I know there was you know we had seem like days of discussion about the two three hours you know we talked about nine we talked about one hour and we finally landed on two and I think we should just just continue it because we're getting ready to have massive construction down there again and we just don't need to create any more turmoil and I do understand that that affects the revenue but you know nobody can do it calculate it.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:55:08.100
End: 01:55:26.100
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: They can do it calculation and say okay all those folks that park for free for 25 minutes how much sales tax revenue did we generate an Aggieville you know for the city you can't capture that at that level and so I think I think we just have to continue what we're doing.

Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: I know I talked about you know looking at the numbers for different fee structure but I don't know that this is the right time to do it I think people are just starting to be comfortable with what we are doing and yeah let's let's not kick a horn it's nest again.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:55:42.100
