Text: So I think this is a unique situation that we have here in a good situation. And so we continue to support this concept, but I think the public needs to understand because sometimes I've had people tell me in this community, oh the conference center, the city paid for it, and we don't get any return on it.

End: 01:33:00.780
Duration: 10.000 seconds

End: 01:34:15.780

City Manager:
Start: 01:34:36.780
End: 01:34:47.780

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:34:47.780
End: 01:35:02.780
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So they asked for us to go to two months. Then the selection community would get together. We have an appointee from the historic resources board. We have an appointee from the park board where you would look for an appointee from the commission to serve on that selection as well.

End: 01:35:12.780

City Manager:
Start: 01:35:12.780
End: 01:35:17.780

End: 01:35:34.780
Duration: 17.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 01:35:34.780
End: 01:35:44.780
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Even some comments were made by Commissioner McKee, like the historic resources board to weigh in on some of those proposals, you could provide that type of direction.

City Manager:
Start: 01:35:44.780
End: 01:35:55.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: If you narrowed it to a number of them or if you just want, you know, you like one now let's hear from the historic resources board and make a recommendation back to us as to how we should proceed.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:35:55.780
End: 01:36:05.780
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: It's very flexible. We're not out on the auction block. We're not out for sale and we're going to take an offer and once that offers made and we accept it, we move right to contract.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:05.780
End: 01:36:20.780
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: We got a lot of latitude to negotiate and work through a number of scenarios. One could be, as we've mentioned before, possibly the property and the land underneath it stays with the city and there's a long term lease.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:20.780
End: 01:36:30.780
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We've done that with other facilities in town. We actually are on the reverse into that with K-State with the headquarters fire station.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:30.780
End: 01:36:36.780
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:36:36.780
End: 01:36:47.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So you have relationships that are long term. You get the life of the building out of the term of the relationship, but you always maintain somewhat control over the land.

Speaker_3:
Start: 01:37:01.780
End: 01:37:19.780
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: You might have just alluded to one, but from my discussions with people in the public, I think the main concern with this isn't necessarily the first agreement that the city would enter into, because we can review and then approve that RFP and then that contract eventually.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 01:37:19.780
End: 01:37:30.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And we know what it's going to be. I think the concern is what happens to years from now, if that developer decides to sell or change direction.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 01:37:30.780
End: 01:37:40.780
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So my question is what mechanisms other than maybe owning the land, does the city have and preserving our original agreement with whoever we sell to?
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:37:40.780
End: 01:37:52.780
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: I'll give you the malls an example. We've had a lease in existence now for about 30 years with the mall. I think we've modified that five or six times.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:37:52.780
End: 01:38:01.780
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: That agreement doesn't allow a transfer of ownership until the governing body actually concurts with that sale.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:38:01.780
End: 01:38:08.780
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: You could write language in there that wouldn't allow them to sell it or lease it without your permission.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:38:08.780
End: 01:38:17.780
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:38:17.780
End: 01:38:24.780
Duration: 7.000 seconds

End: 01:38:29.780

Start: 01:38:32.780
End: 01:38:40.780
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And what would this maybe this is to in the weeds but what happens if they want to sell the city commission doesn't approve them doing that.

Speaker_3:
Start: 01:38:40.780
End: 01:38:45.780
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:38:45.780
End: 01:38:47.780

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:38:47.780
End: 01:39:00.780
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: You know I agree with that I mean I think that would resolve most of the issues I've heard just you know we put in whatever legal language is necessary to be sure the building doesn't disappear.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:00.780
End: 01:39:11.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And I think that can be done. I mean I think it's important to understand that you know this RFP process is simply a method of what I call collecting you know viable ideas of what to do with the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:11.780
End: 01:39:17.780
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:17.780
End: 01:39:25.780
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And approving the process changes nothing. I mean the building still hours nothing gets done with the building until we approve an RFP.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:25.780
End: 01:39:30.780
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:30.780
End: 01:39:37.780
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:37.780
End: 01:39:42.780
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:42.780

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:49.780
End: 01:39:55.780
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And and started that back in 2015 when I suggested that maybe we could use it for social services.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:39:55.780
End: 01:40:04.780
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And that's when Bruce McMillan did the examination of it and we figured out it would cost about two and a half million dollars to just make this thing livable.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:04.780
End: 01:40:10.780
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:10.780
End: 01:40:14.780

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:14.780
End: 01:40:21.780
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: In my mind I've always viewed the end result of the process being that you could draw continuum out there.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:21.780
End: 01:40:25.780
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:25.780
End: 01:40:33.780
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:33.780
End: 01:40:39.780

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:39.780
End: 01:40:43.780
Duration: 4.000 seconds

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:43.780

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:45.780

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:50.780
End: 01:40:55.780
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:55.780
End: 01:40:58.780
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:40:58.780
End: 01:41:05.780
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:41:05.780
End: 01:41:11.780

Speaker_3:
Start: 01:59:09.780
End: 01:59:18.780
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So I think it is worth noting that in the timeline. A couple of other things that I think we should know in the RFP process, and I hope the other commissioners agree with it.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 01:59:18.780
End: 01:59:37.780
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Well, be mostly in the contracting phase. I do think it's important that we know during the RFP, I would hope, again, the rest of the city commissioners agree with this, that if that developer were to ever sell the property or change the nature of what we originally proved, that would be pending city commission approval.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 01:59:37.780
End: 01:59:44.780
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: I really want to avoid a situation in the future. And so I just, I don't think that we should leave that up to just contracting phase.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 01:59:44.780
End: 01:59:48.780
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: We should note that in the RFP proposal as well. And then we include it in the contracting phase.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 01:59:48.780
End: 02:00:02.780
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And then as part of the actual RFP process, I would like to see it get reviewed by both the historic resources board and the Parks and Rec board for recommendations from both of those boards, because I think both of them can weigh in on it.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:00:02.780
End: 02:00:09.780
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Because if we do sell that building, those recreation programs that are currently there now have to go somewhere else, or we have to make a decision on what we do with those.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:00:09.780
End: 02:00:15.780

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:00:15.780
End: 02:00:28.780
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So, including the RFP, that that's a priority for us, that if this ever changes hands, it will be up to city commission approval and that, including those two boards and the RFP process, I think are important.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:00:28.780
End: 02:00:45.780
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: But at this point, I don't have a ton of confidence. It's something I'll keep harping on. But I don't have a ton of confidence that we as a commission are going to set up any long term plans in terms of how we're going to keep up with maintenance of these facilities and these buildings.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:00:45.780

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:00:53.780
End: 02:01:04.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:01:04.780

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:01:08.780
End: 02:01:21.780
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: I agree with what Commissioner McKee said. I think that you could handle having more board input on this by just making them members of the RFP thing instead of a three-part process. That's going to complicate it a bit.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:01:21.780
End: 02:01:32.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: But if you take the hand of the parks board, the historic board and make them part of the committee that picks the RFP, I think that covers that with less bureaucracy involved.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:01:32.780
End: 02:01:44.780
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: The other thing is, as Commissioner McKee said, we're building three new rec centers. So that sort of eliminates anybody wanting to use the community house for a gym anymore.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:01:44.780
End: 02:02:00.780
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So that's one of the things that pushed this. And then lastly, I understand the tax benefit thing. I read a lot about that, but I wouldn't be concerned about that slowing up the RFP process because the idea is if somebody puts in an RFP and says I intend to use tax benefits,
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:02:00.780
End: 02:02:08.780
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: okay, we approve that, but then the contract is another step. And if they don't get the tax benefits by them, you don't approve the contract.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:02:08.780
End: 02:02:17.780
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:02:17.780
End: 02:02:29.780
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: If the guy that wins the RFP falls through on any tax benefits anyone's to have. So I just count that for now, because that's something later on. Let's not snow the process. Let's move on with this thing.

Commissioner McKee:
Start: 02:02:29.780
End: 02:02:41.780

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McKee:
Start: 02:02:41.780
End: 02:02:56.780
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Because they didn't know some things or they didn't have access to some information. I am not in a mad rush. We've waited this long. I don't think it's really terribly waiting a couple of more months is not going to damage any of this.

End: 02:03:41.780

Duration: 19.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 02:04:44.780

Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: I think some may sit back and if we require that, they may have to go hire an engineer, they may have to go hire an architect, they may have to go through a process by which they're spending a lot of money, which may deter them from even applying to see if you all are interested in the concept.
