City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:04:15.000
End: 00:04:28.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So they're not able to discern who is speaking at all times. So just a reminder before you speak to say your name and your position again, because it will be difficult for a viewer to see who speaking if they're not familiar with your voices.

Start: 00:04:28.000
End: 00:04:38.000

End: 00:04:47.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: In light of what of this arrangement we have here, we are still accepting public comments on items online on individual agendas.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:04:47.000
End: 00:04:55.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So anyone can comment that way and they're provided to the commissioners in their packets as well as posted online for anyone to see.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:04:55.000
End: 00:05:07.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So that's one avenue that the public has to comment on any item. The room is limited in its capacity due to the requirements that we have in place for the gathering.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:05:07.000
End: 00:05:17.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: There will a limited number of seats in the room. One thing that we're what kind of where Ron's going is if we do have a large crowd.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:05:17.000
End: 00:05:27.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We may not we're going to have to have them queue up somewhere else and have some kind of crowd control and cycling people in and out. And if depending on the numbers and where they're standing.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:05:27.000
End: 00:05:36.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: If we have a large a large number the policy that Ron's referring to which is your resolution from May of 2018. That's about your meeting procedures.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:05:36.000
End: 00:05:47.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: It allows you either now to adjust the way public comments are set up or at that meeting to make a motion to reduce for example the total comment time from five minutes to a lower amount.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:05:47.000
End: 00:05:55.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: If you have a large crowd and then also just bearing in mind that people aren't going to be waiting in the same way that they they won't necessarily have a seat to wait in.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:05:55.000
End: 00:06:10.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: They might be standing six feet apart. So giving some thought to if we do have a large number. How would that be best facilitated for the public but also for the commission so that you do have an opportunity to do the business that you need to do that night.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:06:10.000
End: 00:06:19.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And bearing in mind that we are also still accepting public comment in written form so we do I mean if someone can submit that way if they prefer.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:06:19.000
End: 00:06:37.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So I think Ron's comments are just to kind of recap how now we have these sort of two ways to public comment. It's going to be a little different because of the limitations of the space and you might want to consider either shortening the time period or giving some guidance on the way it's run logistically in the room.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:06:37.000
End: 00:06:50.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Some other cities are doing a variety of things because of the limitations and in the rooms they are either cutting the time down to a shorter amount or they're saying there's like a certain amount of time as a cap on a comment.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:06:50.000
End: 00:06:56.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So let's say it's a two hour cap. This is just an example a two hour cap two minutes each for example.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:06:56.000
End: 00:07:05.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: But and then they just do first come for serve to fill that time. So there's different ways you can manage it under these unusual circumstances.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:07:05.000
End: 00:07:14.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And I know Jason or Ron have any other comments about some of the logistics that we have in place.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:07:14.000
End: 00:07:32.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: We just talked internally Jason Hill's deputy city manager we talked internally about what other communities have experienced with items that are taking an inordinate amount of time to discuss we know we have some things and upcoming agenda that are going to generate a lot of public interest.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:07:32.000
End: 00:08:01.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So if any just to be clear if any of the commissioners want to revisit this you're saying we can put it on another agenda item we don't have to make any decisions tonight.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:08:01.000
End: 00:08:04.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: You're just seeing if we want to revisit a public comment time.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:08:04.000
End: 00:08:12.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Yes and just kind of understanding the 18th of August we could have beyond capacity.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:08:12.000
End: 00:08:17.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: We think we've developed a system where we could accommodate all the public comment you all want to hear.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:08:17.000
End: 00:08:24.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: But right now it's unlimited and you go to midnight and then the majority want to continue to go to beyond that.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:08:24.000
End: 00:08:30.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: But there isn't really an option to just say public comment done tonight because we're tired.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:08:30.000
End: 00:08:43.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Per this policy we'd be violating our own policy so if you want to set a time limit for that type of public comment this is the appropriate resolution to adjust if the commission desires.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:08:43.000
End: 00:08:51.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And you could do it to this resolution or we could do it the way we did the emergency powers resolution so it'd be a temporary change.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:08:51.000
End: 00:09:00.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And as Jason said it's all it's it's other cities are doing it not only because of the nature of the items but because of the length of time that people are gathered.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:09:00.000
End: 00:09:10.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And perhaps not with a seat they might be standing six feet apart for hours depending on a large crowd we don't have necessarily have room for everybody to rest comfortably.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:09:10.000
End: 00:09:24.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So those are other factors that cities are considering in adjusting these and of course again just want to emphasize we're providing an opportunity for that public comment to occur in writing be posted online and be seen by the commission.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney Katie Jackson:
Start: 00:09:24.000
End: 00:09:28.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: So we're not limiting the overall number it's just the way in which it's received.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:09:28.000
End: 00:09:39.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: We know we've got a challenge if we get beyond 29 people to string people into the gym six feet apart and coordinate comments.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:09:39.000
End: 00:10:04.000
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: So as the agenda item rolls along if there's item if there's comment on the consent agenda or on the general agenda and you want one of the first 29 in here you're going to pay attention to the meeting via our workers out here announcing consent agenda is now if you have public comment on consent agenda now general agenda if you have public comment people will be getting in line we'll be coordinating that.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 00:10:04.000
End: 00:10:14.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So again it's just it could go on for quite some time if we get a lot of people just something to consider sure.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:10:14.000
End: 00:10:22.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Does anybody want to revisit the public comment to item in this nature yeah.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:10:22.000
End: 00:10:51.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I think we need to put some kind of a limit on there if it's is it currently five minutes a person three minutes five so I just don't know what kind of turnout we can kind of expect here so but yeah I would always figure most people out of able to make their point in three minutes after that they're repeating themselves generally but I don't know I would just thinking as we're talking here.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:10:51.000
End: 00:11:20.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I would almost think that in an hour of of comment three minutes per person ought to get pretty much every angle that people would have on an item I would think and so I would kind of want to shoot for that I would my opinion would be to kind of do something like that one hour per item that people want to weigh in on if there's two or three things that people want to comment on that night.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:11:20.000
End: 00:11:38.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Then it would be an hour for each one three minutes per person get to the point and then we're done and kind of move on like that way so just to have a point of discussion that's what I would think it's that ought to be long enough I would think.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:11:38.000
End: 00:12:07.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: I am happy with the five minutes we have never been overwhelmed and I don't want to shut off the public's access to come to to make comments based on the fear that we will be overwhelmed if we begin to be and I don't mean once but if we begin to be overwhelmed we can make a policy that will adjust and fit.

Text: I know that I wanted to speak and that's what democracy is and that's what I want our commission to be. I don't want to disrupt business I know we have business we have to take care of but as far as I'm concerned there's a way to schedule we may not have a lot of other business the night we do face masks so we don't have to limit it to one hour.

Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:13:01.000

Text: When we previously talked about this is a my ready when we previously talked about the public comment we had discussed three minutes we discussed limiting it to five people and such I think you know I'm okay with keeping it as is most people don't speak for five minutes and I understand people that might be repetitive and in the comments they have to make but I always felt that if they took the time out of their life to come and say something on an issue for budget we may not have anybody but if there's an issue there's a lot of people that are not going to be able to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going to speak and I'm not going

Text: Thank you Jason. When you say ballot question and policy resolution to give to the county, the policy resolution, they're not voting on a policy resolution. All they see is this question, right?
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:24:56.800
End: 02:25:18.800
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: So the ballot question resolution is what is referenced in the memo. If the commission desires to adopt a separate policy resolution, which it did no to and 12 primarily because it was part of a county question and we needed to further define how we were going to use it for economic development purposes.

Start: 02:25:18.800
End: 02:25:33.800

Start: 02:25:33.800

Start: 02:25:42.800
End: 02:26:01.800
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: With the percentages in the question, again, our history would show us we didn't have to adopt a resolution, a policy resolution. If the percentages are pulled out and you're just broadly talking about categories, then the policy resolution would make sense. And that's what we've done in the past.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 02:26:01.800
End: 02:26:21.800
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, I think, I'm already uncomfortable. I mean, I think we're going to discuss the question itself, but I would also be comfortable having a different resolution to give a clear definition of what workforce housing is and we discussed the advisory board and all of that.

Start: 02:26:21.800
End: 02:26:39.800
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Also, you know, talking about jobs and some of these other details for future commissioners as they make the decisions. I don't mean like getting into the weeds, but I mean giving some parameters, not boundaries, so much as parameters for them to kind of consider when some of those decisions are being made.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 02:26:39.800
End: 02:26:45.800
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So I would like to see both of those, although the question is what the public will be voting on.

Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:26:45.800
End: 02:27:11.800
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: I just show you the 2012 policy resolution and we can get this out to you all so you can look at it in greater detail. But when it comes down to this policy resolution, a lot of background information just about past economic development uses questions that were incorporated resolutions that were passed, how those things were, just a lot of background.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:27:11.800
End: 02:27:24.800
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The purpose basically is to adopt these guidelines that will govern the processes and procedures. And again, economic development was just so broadly used in that question, it needed further definition.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:27:24.800
End: 02:27:39.800
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So it set for the funds governed, which were obviously the 12 rally county sales tax. The initiatives themselves talked about those traditional company incentives infrastructure and then property tax relief.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:27:39.800
End: 02:28:03.800
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: Which again, we're our definition of economic development. So we provided definitions for the public. The distribution of funds, I would say, in the fund process and procedures were really more about getting the percentages identified that then we would report back to you on an annual basis. And when we talk about the fund, we still talk about 3565 today.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:28:03.800
End: 02:28:16.800
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: We talked about 35 to debt 65 to eco-divo. And then what does the economic development mean? A lot of opportunity for that to be interpreted for infrastructure and a variety of ways.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:28:16.800
End: 02:28:43.800
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: And it it attents to delineate that here. But again, there's just a lot of discretion at the commission level, even with this policy. The policy itself, it isn't all that long. And it somewhat just repeats what's in the question. But for this question in particular, the distribution of funds, which really identified the percentages.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:28:43.800
End: 02:29:07.800
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: And these three definitions of economic development were necessary at that time with that question. And that's the challenge we have in front of us. It doesn't necessarily have to even be decided tonight because if the question is pursued, the governing body could pass a policy resolution on the 18th of August, September 1, September 15.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:29:07.800
End: 02:29:27.800
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: And I think something in advance of the vote would make sense if you want to keep working on that and massaging it. But again, it's one of those things where staff at this point, given the question that's been drafted. And our opinions, you wouldn't necessarily have to have a policy resolution.

Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 02:29:27.800
End: 02:29:41.800
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I will discuss that further. I will open it up for city commissioners and comments. I was the one who said the 60 30 10 and I'm still in favor of the 60 30 10. But commissioner comments.

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:29:41.800
End: 02:29:56.800
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Commissioner had us all here. I still like the 70 20 10 because I think it gives us the most flexibility with the largest amount in the debt infrastructure. And I would like to add. And in fact, my preference would be to call it property tax relief.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:29:56.800
End: 02:30:12.800
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So we can actually leave slash infrastructure, flash slash debt because it's at 70% 4 and a half million a year. That's currently seven mills, which would be a big economic development thing if we could drop the property tax seven mills.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:30:12.800
End: 02:30:21.800
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Not that we would because a lot of it's got to go to debt protection. But I still like the 70 2010 because it gives us the most flexibility.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:30:21.800
End: 02:30:34.800
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: It still gives the jobs thing 1.3 million a year, which is, yeah, a lot. I think I should be plenty to give the chamber 300,000 to do the contract and still give a million a year for.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:30:34.800
End: 02:30:52.800
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Whatever that would be business incentives and then if it requires some infrastructure at train spur or something like that rail spur, not that anybody uses the training more, but we could have a million dollars set aside for that or you can use a million dollars out of the infrastructure part to help with something along that line.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:30:52.800
End: 02:31:10.800
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And I don't know if that would be even something that if we ever come up with the with a location out my airport or somewhere for another business part, I would think the infrastructure debt slash property tax relief thing could be helpful.

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:31:11.800

Start: 02:31:17.800
End: 02:31:31.800
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, and that's a good point that we've talked about internally to our full 5 million for end bath that was used as part of our incentive package could be coming out of debt and infrastructure under this structure.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:31:31.800
End: 02:31:52.800
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: It would not become it you could go either way, but you could easily debt service all of the improvements we made for end bath and that's where that incentive package could fully reside in that 70% versus taking a half, you know, $5 million out of a $13 million pot.
--------------------------------------------------
Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 02:31:52.800
End: 02:31:57.800

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:31:58.800
End: 02:32:15.800
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So with that, yeah, that's why I'm interested in the 70, 2010 and then adding a kind of property tax relief to that various slashes on the debt infrastructure line just because I think that would be we were concerned that having debt listed first is like well people aren't going to be excited about debt.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:32:15.800
End: 02:32:18.800

Duration: 12.000 seconds

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:32:30.800

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:32:36.800
End: 02:32:47.800
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So having it first is going to have some some attractors and some detractors, but I'm willing to keep that first because there we need everybody as much as possible on board to help get this thing.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:32:48.800

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:32:59.800
End: 02:33:14.800

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 02:33:14.800
End: 02:33:29.800
