Jurdine Coleman:
Start: 00:48:11.240
End: 00:48:31.240

Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: The department requires greater level of analysis and application for cost recovery model zero based budgeting exercise is recommended staffing is at a higher level than the NRP standards so the recommendation will be as vacancies come up to maybe spread the task differently and for increased effectiveness without any additional benefits.

Jurdine Coleman:
Start: 00:50:19.240
End: 00:50:46.240
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: And for increased effectiveness without adding staff pricing for different facilities rentals of cost recoveries are less than 100% we typically see that that's basically somebody reserves something that's giving them exclusive use of a public facility and therefore is typically at least 100% of what it costs to clean that pickup trash those types of things.
