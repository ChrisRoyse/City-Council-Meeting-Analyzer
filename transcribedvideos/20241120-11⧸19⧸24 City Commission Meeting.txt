Text: And I've used this example when I talk to people about really room nights is how much is impacted when you have seven home games or six home games or when case-state basketball conflicts with two-aid basketball and we don't get the two-aid basketball tournament that year, which is the case that's happened this year.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:36:51.000
End: 02:37:04.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So there's external circumstances that impact sort of the overall room nights where we might have had a great year, but two or three of those events that are out of our control tend to have a negative impact on the overall numbers.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:37:04.000
End: 02:37:07.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds

Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: I do want to mention real quick on the, because I just want to remind everybody on the CVB request, we have a committee that is appointed because of our contract with you all.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:37:19.000
End: 02:37:29.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And it's specifically in the contract that we have a committee that is to advise the Chamber and the City Commission on expenditure of TGT funds.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:37:29.000
End: 02:37:33.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:37:33.000
End: 02:37:46.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So it comes through the Chamber, but the board basically is a rubber stamp on that committee's request and that committee is made up of hotel, restaurant, attractions, kind of the typical you would expect on a tourism board.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:37:46.000
End: 02:38:02.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And we had a lengthy discussion, not this year as much as last year, about maintaining the 60% because there's been an unwritten rule that predated me, certainly predated Marsha, that that 60% of the TGT was allocated to the CVB.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:38:02.000
End: 02:38:17.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Historically, years ago, and Commissioner McCullough prior remembers this, it used to be 100% to the CVB. And over time, some of that has been peeled off for other projects. And those are worthy projects. And we've obviously made it work.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:38:17.000
End: 02:38:26.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And that circumstance is we made it work during COVID when we got cut 50%. And basically lost a million dollars over two years during COVID. And we figured that out too.

City Manager:
Start: 02:38:26.000
End: 02:38:36.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We understand that you all have to make decisions. The recommendation on the budget comes from the CVB committee that is a contractual obligation that we have with you all.

City Manager:
Start: 02:38:36.000
End: 02:38:49.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So I just want to also wonder a reminder. And so we will take back anything that you all say to that committee, which means December 4th, and Commissioner McCullough sits on that committee representing you all.

Commissioner Opelt:
Start: 02:38:49.000
End: 02:39:13.000

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Opelt:
Start: 02:39:24.000
End: 02:39:42.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So it kind of does tie in with the metrics, but adding on to what you were talking about, I would like to see those metrics to be kind of more targeted at variables that you have the most control over.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Opelt:
Start: 02:39:42.000
End: 02:39:59.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: I know you don't control a lot of the variables, but you know, things like net migration, that's really hard for the Chamber to say we affected that just because of the broader economic environment.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Opelt:
Start: 02:39:59.000
End: 02:40:14.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: But you know, things like jobs created average wage of jobs, things like that. I think those are really great. I also want to ask if you have metrics that you've been tracking so that we can kind of have a baseline for maybe even just 2024.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Opelt:
Start: 02:40:14.000
End: 02:40:18.000

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:40:18.000
End: 02:40:27.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So every metric that we that we gave to you all for this, we will have reported to you at the end of the year for 24. So we'll have a baseline of 24 and all those metrics.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:40:27.000
End: 02:40:36.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And you're right. So there's things like net migration that we don't have control over, but there are important things for us as a community to track.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:40:36.000
End: 02:40:50.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Sure. And so we want to also because we feel like we're your contractual agency on those kind of things, we want to make sure that those are things that you all know when you're making your decisions going forward. And so we think it's important to report.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:40:50.000
End: 02:41:03.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But yes, we'll have baseline for every one of those items and we're working on that spreadsheet. If you know Stacy Komaer, who's our chairman next year, she is a spreadsheet freak actually kind of makes me really comfortable with all that.

City Manager:
Start: 02:41:03.000

City Manager:
Start: 02:41:13.000
End: 02:41:26.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: We do spell out exactly what we're spending the money for. That's a little bit different than the CVB which because CVB is 100% funded by TGT, whereas the economic development is about 30% funded through city.

City Manager:
Start: 02:41:26.000

Start: 02:43:34.000
End: 02:43:46.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:44:16.000
End: 02:44:34.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: That's what we're looking at. Funding for CVB, I'm at number of room nights, I think that's important rather than just dollar amounts, because if room rates are going up, that doesn't necessarily mean number of people coming to town are the same.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:44:34.000
End: 02:44:47.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So I look at, I would put the CVB on a sliding scale to be honest, is if they hit their target, they get 60% if they get more, you know, have more room nights, they get more or less.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:44:47.000

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 02:45:07.000
End: 02:45:24.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Like if we're, you know, having a strategy, or we target even athletic events, but say our room nights go up because we got other conventions, it's like, well, but this is what we were focusing on, you know, versus just a shotgun, anything that goes up, we consider it a great outcome.

Commissioner Opelt:
Start: 02:45:47.000

City Manager:
Start: 03:31:57.000
End: 03:32:08.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 03:32:08.000
End: 03:32:26.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: New development continues to happen. There's opportunities where we see of maybe realigning or adding new street connections along with parks and trail connections throughout the whole triangle to try to improve mobility within the triangle and connection to the neighborhoods adjacent to the triangle as well.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:27.000
End: 03:32:46.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: In particular, we think about, for example, in the southwest of this area moving into the Manhattan Town Center and the downtown is so close by that addressing the needs to improve the total creepable of our, the crossings, the intersections, people get over to the triangle.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:46.000

City Manager:
Start: 03:32:54.000
End: 03:33:09.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So thinking about that whole idea then of actually thinking about land use, we've then kind of also pulled out a framework saying that let's think about the ways in which these uses today but how they might evolve in the future.

City Manager:
Start: 03:33:09.000

City Manager:
Start: 03:33:33.000
End: 03:33:48.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: There's been a lot of recent investment in fast food and so forth. So there's not a lot of near term expectation for change, but we would see opportunities to improve safety, definitely crossing that road, allowing more pedestrian ability.

City Manager:
Start: 03:33:48.000
End: 03:33:56.000

Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: There's buildings here that may become obsolete at some point in the time and to think about how we could have uses that might come in there like distilleries often like to go into these districts because the buildings are big enough and the rents are low enough, but then they kind of have a component to them where there's a, a common go, there's people there that are experiencing the spaces into allow that sort of flexibility.

City Manager:
Start: 03:34:42.000
End: 03:34:59.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And in this instance, one of the key drivers here is, well, first and foremost, I want to make sure is that we know that KDOT is going to be analyzing and doing a pretty deep analysis of this corridor in 2025 beginning of 2025.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:34:59.000

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:35:13.000
End: 03:35:42.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: But in this instance, what we want to be able to do is go, well, we think in sort of a big, you know, the big move here as they say would be probably trying to get more frontage and or backage road systems in this area to help kind of navigate and sort of sift and sort local traffic, people who live in the area that want to shop in those businesses close by and not putting more pressure on then 24, which is facilitating the movement east west.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:35:43.000
End: 03:36:12.000
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So, we're going to be able to do a lot of traffic through Potawatomi County and Indirailly County. So a backage and a frontage road system complemented again by a system of some multi-use paths, bikes, pedestrians, you know, people can accommodate wheelchairs, though that can be complemented in this area, as well as some other more naturalized trail systems to help people get maybe to some of the amenities that are along the river.

City Manager:
Start: 03:36:21.000
End: 03:36:39.000

City Manager:
Start: 03:36:39.000

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:36:50.000
End: 03:37:08.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: There's a mixture of things in there, but what we would like to see at key intersections is maybe a little bit more attention given to concentrating like and complementary uses to create more of a nodal function so that there could be, you know, more ability for particularly people who are looking for the right type of equipment.

City Manager:
Start: 03:37:08.000

Start: 03:37:35.000
End: 03:37:51.000

City Manager:
Start: 03:37:51.000
End: 03:38:03.000

City Manager:
Start: 03:38:03.000

Text: And as one is we know it's critical to understand the potential fiscal impact of this type of planning. So we are going through an exercise where we are going to be able to look at maybe a couple of different growth scenarios and evaluate them based on high level cost estimates of the recommended infrastructure.

City Manager:
