End: 01:56:35.620
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: We feel that track C has some potential for a neighborhood green space but those utility restrictions are really significant and so the the potential for recreation on track C is is more is most likely a short neighborhood trail connector that would connect Bramblewood to shadow Ridge Drive but other park amenities are really limited by that gas easement track D has the potential for some trail development as part of the trail.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:56:36.620
End: 01:57:05.620
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So we know that those Roger Schultz park trails there are obviously some access concerns not having any street frontage or access and that that primarily comes from a forestry aspect we don't typically actively manage these wild land forests but if there is a tree that's dead or dying and in danger of falling or does fall on the private property we would have as an owner we would have responsibility to come in and remove or take care of that hazard.

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:57:05.620
End: 01:57:34.620
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: And so accessing this track for those type of purposes would be pretty limited but would be difficult to do in the cases where that would occur and then on on track H this is the track that we feel is the most valuable from a recreation standpoint and again because of the size the number of the miles of trail that could be added to that and the contiguous nature with the Schultz park and the connection to the VMI tractor what make that most the most appealing of the three.

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:57:35.620

Text: So this is a slide that we've shown before relative to VMI as well as the Stone Haven park properties and it's kind of a view of trail connectivity conceptually in this part of town and so we have Warner Park and the potential for trail connections to the Stone Haven park site which will be next on the agenda trail connections from there through pedestrian easements to the VMI tract trail potential.

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:58:05.620
