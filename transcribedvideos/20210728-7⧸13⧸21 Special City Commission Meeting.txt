Text: The talent we're going to focus very closely on later in tonight's presentation so I'll leave that for that time from a housing standpoint obviously there's study going on at the city level we also look forward to where the 10% of the the half sent sales tax and and workforce housing what that leads to and believe that that can be an important component an important tool in the future of our our ability to to attract jobs to this community and then with childcare this is an issue that the chamber is taking a look at and play the role in the past.

Text: I also want to highlight retention expansion projects and so there are a number of the potential expansion projects that show up on our project list and and we'll take a look at some numbers little later on but there's a number of those that show up that come directly out of George's efforts so that has been that has been a business retention expansion visit that has has turned into a discussion about a future project what resources might be able to come to the table from a local standpoint maybe a state department of commerce standpoint maybe there's a challenge on the table.

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:06:53.380

Text: From an application standpoint one of the reasons that becomes so important I think can be seen in the in the relatively recent McCall's announcement in that case you've got a company that has made significant investment in other communities maybe in other facilities.

Start: 01:07:17.380
