Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:06:59.000

Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:07:28.000
End: 00:07:36.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:07:43.000
End: 00:07:53.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Usha Reddi:
Start: 00:08:45.000
End: 00:08:52.000

Start: 00:08:52.000
End: 00:09:07.000

Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:09:07.000
End: 00:09:23.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, I think one of the things I noticed even during this comment this piece right here in the past few minutes is we've evolved so much just from our initial and March meetings that we can actually do this now, whereas before it was very, very difficult to participate.

Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:09:23.000

Jared Wasinger:
Start: 00:09:45.000
End: 00:09:52.000

Start: 00:09:52.000
End: 00:10:02.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Jared Wasinger:
Start: 00:10:41.000
End: 00:10:57.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Jared Wasinger:
Start: 00:10:57.000

Jared Wasinger:
Start: 00:11:14.000
End: 00:11:21.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, that's an option we can explore if we go to completely virtual.

Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:11:21.000
End: 00:11:27.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds

Start: 00:12:02.000
End: 00:12:10.000

Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:12:59.000
End: 00:13:06.000

Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:13:06.000
End: 00:13:17.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Commissioner Linda Morse:
Start: 00:13:17.000
