Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Yeah. So what I'd hoped to do, we're still working through some feasibility studies, but hopefully we could put some housing there. Right now that house is in terrible shape. It's dilapidated, it's falling down, it's crumbling. Some of the units aren't even livable. They're uninhabitable at the moment.

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:53:51.880
End: 01:54:00.880

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:54:00.880
End: 01:54:20.880

Text: So and then when thinking about that and being cognizant of the residential areas to the north that are growing and you know continuing expand likewise we see that if there's an industrial district or a strong commercial district that does form north of 24 that there would be an idea of thinking of how to sort of transition those uses between single family detached homes with these commercial uses and that there's opportunities to maybe introduce different forms of work.
