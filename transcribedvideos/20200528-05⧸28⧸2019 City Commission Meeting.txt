End: 00:04:41.000
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: The Harvey Drive Area of the Dix edition and in the Knoxbury edition today, and they plan to continue to do that tomorrow again to provide some overview information, and part of what they're doing is to determine whether folks in any particular area have any kind of special needs that would require additional assistance in the event of an evacuation.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:04:41.000
End: 00:04:54.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Also, I would just encourage residents to visit the city's website and also sign up for emergency notifications on the Everbridge system and the event of evacuation.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:04:54.000
End: 00:05:10.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: That's where we would provide that information for folks to evacuate. Also, in the event of an evacuation, our emergency personnel would be going door-to-door in those neighborhoods to let folks know that they would need to evacuate.

Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:05:11.000
End: 00:05:21.000

--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:05:21.000
End: 00:05:32.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So, the action stage there on the Kansas is around 14. We usually close our flood control gates on the Levy at about 15 roughly.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:05:32.000
End: 00:05:53.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: That's good news. The forecast is for it to be below 14 by Saturday. That helps us. When those gates are closed, if we get a very heavy rain of several inches, then we have a bathtub effect where we have to pump that water through the Levy.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:05:53.000
End: 00:06:04.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: We're certainly able to handle the rains that occurred over the weekend. So, the gates have been closed probably since about last Thursday, roughly.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:06:04.000
End: 00:06:15.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So, again, that's a good information. I understand that on Thursday, we're planning to hold another news conference. That one was carried live on Cayman.

Start: 00:06:15.000
End: 00:06:27.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And we did do live broadcast on Facebook and City of Manhattan website. Thank you. That's all ahead, Mayor. Thank you.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:06:27.000
End: 00:06:41.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I think having the Kansas River down is helpful when we're letting water out of the tubes because somebody said, I think last week, we had water from the Kansas all the way up to near Rocky Fort.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:06:41.000
End: 00:06:54.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So, it just shows you the power of that water when it gets up pretty high. Right now, having it go down allows the blue to flow pretty evenly. So, that's really good news.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:06:54.000
End: 00:07:06.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We now move to item three, which is a consent agenda. These are items which are routine in nature or have been considered by the commission once before.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:07:06.000
End: 00:07:15.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And we ask if this time, if any of the commissioners would like to have any questions or comments on these.

End: 00:07:27.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:07:28.000
End: 00:07:38.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I think I want to discuss that. That's the one I mentioned earlier that calls for a 50-50 split of the costs.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:07:38.000
End: 00:07:48.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And because these owners, several of them, have not cooperated, one was out of state, whatever all the stories are.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:07:48.000
End: 00:08:02.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I'm not willing for the city to pick up the remainder. And so, I'd like for us to vote this evening to split that 50-50 and assess the residents.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:08:02.000
End: 00:08:06.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:08:16.000
End: 00:08:17.000
Duration: 1.000 seconds
Text: N?
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:08:17.000
End: 00:08:27.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So, it is the 17th Street Sanitary Suer Improvements. And we are recommending to withdraw that item from the consent agenda for a future meeting.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:08:27.000
End: 00:08:29.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds

Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Ron, on item G, could you just talk a little bit about how the research park circle and the research park drive got added to that?

End: 00:09:30.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:09:30.000
End: 00:09:46.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: That would be the K-State Foundation and Kansas State University requesting that the parking be taking off research park circle and research park drive to allow for better traffic flow within that development.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:09:46.000
End: 00:09:55.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: There has been a lot of cars parked on the streets in that area, and we'd met with them and had some requests.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:09:55.000
End: 00:10:16.000
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: There has been some obviously some transition of ownership with the KSUIC building that went from city ownership to the university ownership, and that's had some issues with that transition from something that really didn't have parking restrictions and that parking lot to one that now is a city university lot with parking restrictions.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:10:16.000
End: 00:10:25.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Commissioner McKee:
Start: 00:10:25.000
End: 00:10:36.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: If considering if we pass G tonight, it would go to second reading in two weeks, how soon and if we passed in that scenario, how soon would it take effect after we pass that?
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:10:36.000
End: 00:10:41.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: It would take effect after publication of the ordinance in the paper.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:10:42.000
End: 00:10:44.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McKee:
Start: 00:10:44.000
End: 00:11:09.000
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: Okay, well then my only comment regarding this consent is I'm not going to be supporting that tonight only because I could understand the long term need to start to regulate parking there, but for such a long time, that has been a place that people could park and if civic plus told me tomorrow, then I needed to pay $189 within the next few weeks in order to park in their lot, that would be put me in a financial disposition.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McKee:
Start: 00:11:09.000
End: 00:11:21.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So I'd rather us take an approach of maybe closing one side of it down, maybe try to change behavior over the time, but to just flat out, close it after two or three weeks after a couple of readings of an ordinance, that's not something I can support.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner McKee:
Start: 00:11:21.000
End: 00:11:24.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So I'll be voting no on item G.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:11:24.000
End: 00:11:30.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So I have a question about item G. So is this coming from Adibus at all?
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:11:30.000
End: 00:11:32.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: No, it's totally unrelated to Adibus.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:11:32.000
End: 00:11:40.000
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Because the premise was that some of these were because of Adibus and some weren't as far as I was reading all the stops that they had.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:11:40.000
End: 00:11:46.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So the no parking at any time has nothing to do with Adibus at all. This is just because of other.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:11:46.000
End: 00:11:53.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: We were just taking the action for the ordinance is the same for both and so we just lumped them all together.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:11:53.000
End: 00:12:00.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: But no, there was nothing related to the transit service relative to the specific request in research part.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:00.000
End: 00:12:04.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: But to clarify, Adibus wants to know parking at their stops.
--------------------------------------------------
Trevor McKeeman:
Start: 00:12:04.000
End: 00:12:06.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:06.000
End: 00:12:11.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: No. The research drive is two separate things they got combined.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dawson:
Start: 00:12:11.000
End: 00:12:12.000
Duration: 1.000 seconds
Text: That's what I want to come up with.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:12.000
End: 00:12:14.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: I'm going to vote for it because I want to support the Adibus thing.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:14.000
End: 00:12:18.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And you did say the building of Longstay State on research drive.

Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:18.000
End: 00:12:19.000
Duration: 1.000 seconds
Text: Right.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:19.000
End: 00:12:21.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: So they have the right to regulate their parking.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:21.000
End: 00:12:23.000
Duration: 2.000 seconds
Text: So I don't have a problem supporting it.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner York:
Start: 00:12:24.000
End: 00:12:30.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
