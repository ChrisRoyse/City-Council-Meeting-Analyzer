Start: 01:15:14.360
End: 01:15:32.360

Start: 02:11:01.360

Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: To address some of the concerns around riding on sidewalks or maybe on areas of campus with trails, actually eScooters would be better than bikes because you could geocache areas on campus where the eScooters would just shut off before they enter.

Speaker_0:
Start: 02:11:34.360

Speaker_0:
Start: 02:11:58.360
End: 02:12:19.360
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: I think there's best practices that have already been established. I think one aspect of this as well is to be conscious of the eScooter company that K state and the community contracts with some of the larger companies have like self imposed taxes that can be used to support active transportation infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 02:12:19.360

End: 02:12:53.360

Speaker_0:
Start: 02:12:53.360
End: 02:13:05.360

Start: 02:13:05.360
End: 02:13:19.360
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: It's a great way to earn some extra money. Also, if you're concerned around equity, this is also addressing equity issues. The research suggests that eScooters help close the one mile gap that public transportation leaves.

Speaker_0:
Start: 02:13:19.360
End: 02:13:28.360
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Speaker_0:
Start: 02:13:28.360
End: 02:13:42.360
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Also, the research suggests that there's a gender dynamic to this that eScooters are a gateway mode of transportation for women that might be reluctant to walk or ride a bike.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 02:13:42.360
End: 02:13:57.360
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Also, this is a quality of life issue. So when we think about attracting the types of students that we want to attend K state, also the professionals we want to stay here in Manhattan, these are the types of amenities that people are becoming to expect.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 02:13:57.360
End: 02:14:16.360
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So when we look at our peer and aspirational college towns, they've already adopted this stuff. So it's already in practice. The other aspect as well is that the research suggests that over 80% of all eScooters are operated within a two mile radius.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_0:
Start: 02:14:16.360
End: 02:14:43.360

Text: And for a community like Manhattan, that connects K state, Aggieville and the downtown business district. So just to reiterate, I hear a repress any the people, the bike walk and HK, I really encourage you to approve eScooters with regulations by commissioning an expert pass force to help develop those commission, those regulations, be very conscious of the companies that the city works with.

Mayor Dodson:

End: 02:17:24.360
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: My initial concern, and I'm not an expert in e-scooters, and that hasn't changed throughout tonight's discussion, is the idea of authorizing a motorized vehicle of some kind to operate on city sidewalks anywhere in the city, not just Aggieville or downtown. I have a concern about that.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:17:24.360
End: 02:17:46.360
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: The other issue is, and I was glad to see when the Lyme vehicle was brought up here that there was a helmet hanging off the handlebars. In the regulation that you may pass, the ordinance you may pass, whether it involves a commercial company or people that own them privately, I would ask you to make that a requirement that helmets be worn. It's a safety feature.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:17:46.360
End: 02:18:13.360
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: The e-scooter runs into anything larger than who's operating it. They're going to be able to disadvantage in the collision and what happens afterwards. Having a helmet and being a bicyclist myself and getting hit by a car about 30 years ago, I landed on my head and my helmet did its job and I walked away with just some road rash. If I hadn't had a helmet, it could have been much worse, if not fatal.

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:18:13.360
End: 02:18:29.360
Duration: 16.000 seconds

Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I don't want to mislead you and say that enforcement on this will be diligent and regular. Depending on how many of these things end up in the city, whether they're commercial privately owned, it will be a challenge to consistently enforce that.

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:18:54.360

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:19:03.360
End: 02:19:11.360
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: If they're on the sidewalk and that's prohibited, that's a much easier enforcement action to take. It's pretty obvious if they're not supposed to be on sidewalks.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:19:11.360
End: 02:19:29.360
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: But when it comes to speed, I don't have a specific answer for you at this point in how we would do that. But I can almost assure you that the number of calls and complaints we would get would most likely by the time the officer arrived there, the e-scooter and the rider would be gone if it was a speeding complaint.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:19:29.360
End: 02:19:41.360
Duration: 12.000 seconds
