City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:07:34.400
End: 00:07:49.040

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:07:49.040
End: 00:07:56.800

Start: 00:07:56.800
End: 00:08:05.680
Duration: 8.880 seconds

City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:08:26.600

Start: 00:08:40.720
End: 00:08:47.120
Duration: 6.400 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:08:47.120
End: 00:08:51.920
Duration: 4.800 seconds
Text: So our bond council and financial advisors are putting that out there for the buyers.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:08:51.920
End: 00:08:55.200
Duration: 3.280 seconds
Text: So they recognize that parameter anyway.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:08:55.200
End: 00:09:09.000
Duration: 13.800 seconds
Text: This as Ron mentioned, it's really helpful on the staff side from the clerk's perspective and from finance perspective to have these sales occur on the Thursday, which is the Thursday before the next Tuesday.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:09:09.000
End: 00:09:23.040
Duration: 14.040 seconds
Text: It allows them to eat all the paperwork necessary, the approvals and the banks at a position, the investors in a position earlier in the day, then waiting for that signature and that action later that evening.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:09:23.040
End: 00:09:38.360
Duration: 15.320 seconds
Text: The other thing I would mention is that next action item, it's not a point in time to really start questioning the investment, what putting those bonds out.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:09:38.360
End: 00:09:40.280
Duration: 1.920 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:09:40.280
End: 00:09:45.440
Duration: 5.160 seconds
Text: It's not it's not a moment where, oh, I thought we were going to get X and we got Y.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:09:45.440
End: 00:09:47.240
Duration: 1.800 seconds
Text: We're not going to do this.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:09:47.320
End: 00:09:53.360
Duration: 6.040 seconds
Text: That bank is under the assumption as well as everybody else participating that that is going to go through.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:09:53.360
End: 00:10:06.440
Duration: 13.080 seconds
Text: So not a whole lot different when we get here Tuesday nights and we've sold them earlier that day, but there is a delay that would be four or five days later now.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:10:06.440
End: 00:10:16.880
Duration: 10.440 seconds
Text: But as the bond council and our financial advisors explain, it would be detrimental to the city to stop that or not pass.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:10:16.880
End: 00:10:18.360
Duration: 1.480 seconds
Text: That's the second resolution.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:10:18.360
End: 00:10:21.400
Duration: 3.040 seconds
Text: So just wanted to get you comfortable with the timing.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:10:21.400
End: 00:10:25.320
Duration: 3.920 seconds
Text: It's different, but it is more efficient in how we're going to do our business.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:10:27.440
End: 00:10:40.560
Duration: 13.120 seconds
Text: And one of the things we talked about doing was when we, you know, the steps prior leading up to that bond sale is just when we're bringing an item, either for a ward of a contract.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:10:40.560
End: 00:10:44.800
Duration: 4.240 seconds
Text: Indicating that we are planning to bond this item at that particular time.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:10:44.800
End: 00:10:56.520
Duration: 11.720 seconds
Text: This is how we're planning to finance it so that you know at time of a ward that that's that's the plan moving forward and identifying when that might occur.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:10:56.520
End: 00:11:08.200
Duration: 11.680 seconds
Text: A lot of times you're familiar with some projects where we've actually that's been part of the action item for you is to approve those, approve those note sales or that or that bond sale as part of the construction item.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:08.200
End: 00:11:14.640
Duration: 6.440 seconds
Text: So that's really the time to say go no go as opposed to when we're actually selling the bonds.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:14.640
End: 00:11:22.520
Duration: 7.880 seconds
Text: Now, obviously if we projected that the interest rate was going to be one and a half percent that comes in at seven percent.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:22.520
End: 00:11:26.680
Duration: 4.160 seconds
Text: That that would be outside the terms that we set up originally anyway.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:26.680
End: 00:11:29.440
Duration: 2.760 seconds
Text: So those are different type of scenarios.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:29.440
End: 00:11:37.600
Duration: 8.160 seconds
Text: Anyway, that's I want to spend a little bit of time on that this evening to kind of give you that heads up more to come is that gets closer to being scheduled.

City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:37.600
End: 00:11:44.560
Duration: 6.960 seconds
Text: Yeah, more so any potential bitter bank investors would know our parameters before they.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:44.560
End: 00:11:54.240
Duration: 9.680 seconds
Text: Yes, so there if we say 0.01 percent up to 1.99 they know that if they're going to come in at two and a half don't bother right.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:54.240
End: 00:11:58.760
Duration: 4.520 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:11:59.560
End: 00:12:05.440
Duration: 5.880 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 00:12:05.440
End: 00:12:06.040
