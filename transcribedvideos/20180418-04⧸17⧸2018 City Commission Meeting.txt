--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:38:08.640
End: 02:38:18.640
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:38:18.640
End: 02:38:29.640
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:38:29.640

Text: Thank you, Mayor, commissioners. So with the discussions on tax income and financing and industrial revenue bonds, the tax abatement, we wanted to kind of bring forth another economic development tool that's available in the state that other cities and Kansas are using.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:33:46.640
End: 03:33:59.640
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So we wanted to just bring this forth so we could have some discussion and introduce you to the tool and then see if the commission wanted to maybe move forward with a similar policy like we do with IRBs.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:33:59.640
End: 03:34:12.640
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So I'm just going to kind of go over CIDs in general and then go into a little bit more detail on the statutory requirements when it comes to the community improvement district act.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:34:12.640
End: 03:34:19.640
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And then I'm going to go into a little bit of comparison of CIDs and TDDs transportation development districts. They are very similar.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:34:19.640
End: 03:34:32.640
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But as CID is much more broad tool and then kind of look at what other cities and Kansas are doing when it comes to their CID policies that they've adopted and see how we want to move forward.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:34:33.640
End: 03:34:43.640
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So CID allows a district to establish a new revenue source to finance public or private real estate improvements.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:34:43.640
End: 03:34:53.640
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And these revenues that fund these improvements can be through a special assessment or a district only sales tax within the district that's defined.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:34:53.640
End: 03:34:59.640
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And these revenues can be used very broadly pretty much for anything public or private development.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:34:59.640
End: 03:35:14.640
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So new construction, renovation redevelopment and acquisition of property it can even go as far as maintenance of the facility, security of the district or a facility in the area.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:35:14.640
End: 03:35:23.640
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So we wanted to bring this forward because this has been something that developers have approached the city within the past.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:35:23.640
End: 03:35:33.640
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: But we don't because it's such a broad economic development tool and we don't have a policy that really guides administration and the governing body on how to approve a CID.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:35:33.640
End: 03:35:37.640
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: We've kind of steered them toward TDDs.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:35:38.640
End: 03:35:44.640
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: The community improvement district act it was approved by the state in 2009.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:35:44.640
End: 03:36:06.640
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: So when a community improvement district and property owners come forth and they want to establish a district and they have some projects that they want to do within that district, they can finance that project through a number of ways they can use special obligation bonds which would really be funded through just those CID revenues.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:36:06.640
End: 03:36:21.640
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So you can go further with general obligation bonds that's something that's not allowed within transportation development districts or you can do a pay as you go financing method.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:36:21.640
End: 03:36:33.640
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So CID revenue sources like I said you could do special assessments through property taxes much like you see in a benefit district or you could do a district only sales tax.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:36:33.640
End: 03:36:40.640
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So you could add on additional sales tax to that much like a TDD.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:36:40.640
End: 03:36:53.640
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So if you're at McDonald's on 4th and Bluemont you pay 9.45% I believe until sales tax and a half cent sales tax goes to the funding of that transportation development district.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:36:53.640
End: 03:36:56.640
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So similar to a CID.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:36:56.640
End: 03:37:11.640
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: One thing with CIDs you can do is the city can offer full faith and credit of the city so that if in the event that the city feels that they would like to participate financially in a project they could do that if that circumstance came to be.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:37:11.640
End: 03:37:38.640
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: There's really two avenues to form a CID so if you're only doing special assessments and you have 100% of the property owners within the district willing to support the CID really what they'll do is those property owners will file petition which basically goes over the project scope that I describe with the financing method what the project is going to consist of how funds are going to be spent.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:37:38.640
End: 03:37:45.640
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And then commission can proceed with or without a public hearing and approve the CID right there.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:37:45.640
End: 03:38:04.640
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: If a CID is proposing the use of sales tax general obligation bonds or if there's not 100% property owner support it's a little bit more difficult to form a CID you need to get 55% of property owners to file that petition and then you have to proceed with that public hearing process.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:38:04.640
End: 03:38:11.640
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And then the commission can move forward with adopting a CID.

--------------------------------------------------
Casey Kyle:
Start: 03:38:14.640
End: 03:38:22.640
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So when you say 55% of property owners land and assessed value.
--------------------------------------------------
Casey Kyle:
Start: 03:38:22.640
End: 03:38:36.640
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So if one owner owns 45% of the land and that's say there's like six or seven other properties they would be part of that huge majority to increase it right.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:38:36.640
End: 03:38:46.640
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Yes but it would also have to be the land and the assessed value so if one property owner owns 55% of the land but of the total assessed value of the district it's only maybe 35% of the property owner owns 55% of the land.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:38:46.640
End: 03:38:56.640

Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:46:45.640
End: 03:46:51.640

--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:46:51.640
End: 03:46:56.640

Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:46:56.640

Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:47:15.640
End: 03:47:36.640
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: Yeah you would be able to define that district around that area and with your petition that you came forward you would you would outline that district and then you would say what how you would want to create a CID revenue so special assessments or sales tax and then you would put forth what project improvements you would spend that money on.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:47:36.640
End: 03:47:59.640
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So you see other cities limit like to me when you do that in almost and maybe this isn't a bad thing but when you do that it almost becomes an incentive just for developers right it becomes in my opinion a little less incentive for multiple property owners to come together in a neighborhood and do something.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:47:59.640
End: 03:48:16.640
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So do you see other cities like putting a limit on maybe like the minimum amount of property owners that have to be involved or I mean if one one property owner owns all these lots and they want to have their own CID district they're cool with it as long as it meets their minimum investment thresholds.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:48:16.640
End: 03:48:39.640
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: I haven't seen that in other policies I think this is a tool that will help for redevelopments so existing districts you know not just a developer coming into a new district but if you're in a specific commercial district that is you know as maybe blighted or needs redevelopment I think you can see those separate property owners coming together to try and form something like this.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:48:39.640
End: 03:49:08.640
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So most of the CID's genesis has been in redeveloping property not it doesn't have to be exclusively there so you know if you wanted to put a Starbucks or something like you know a coffee franchise you don't need a big area but if you're doing generally speaking one of the bigger costs of redevelopment is property acquisition and so that's where it comes into play especially if you were in a state of mind.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:49:09.640
End: 03:49:38.640
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So we were approached by a developer prior to the Bluemont hotel going in there well that land there I mean that's the highest priced square footage in the city almost except for next to Walmart so you know that those are just some of that cost you know and so and then you typically would want a sales tax producer for whatever you put there so it's it kind of really depends on on what you want to do but it's it's it's developed.
--------------------------------------------------
Mel Boerst:
Start: 03:49:39.640
End: 03:49:46.640
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Text: McCall Road is you know clearly we were a widening call McCall Road we were putting in signals we were making multi million dollar improvements and we were looking for a tool we ended up using a benefit district because we basically assessed both sides of the street they benefited from the project and it's a property tax you know it comes as a special assessment with this tool you can mix in special assessments but primarily a TDD or a CID would have been helpful.

Text: One of the examples that was mentioned was McCall Road so that that really is a great example after Walmart so really when monarchs came to town you remember we approved we're improved McCall to Hayes and then it was the old McCall but when monarchs came to town we actually tried to press them to do a TD and they said.

Text: Their competition in lumber it was they would not meet their margin so but if we had a CID where they would have benefited they could have done some of their entry drive or their parking lot and they would have received more benefit I think they would have done it.

Text: And pot county came to the table too and helped participate in that too so that that's a good example I think of where advancing to the CID tool components then just the TD which limited you to the right away public improvements makes some sense potentially for a particular project.

Text: I just think it this gives us our community more options along with TDD and benefit districts not just corporations so this is something that's accessible to any neighborhood any district anywhere so I yeah except I don't like the 55% we need to increase that somewhere between 55 and 100.
