--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:06:15.280
End: 01:06:27.280
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: But since we took about $250,000 from ICODIVA to support the initiative, I think it just, I feel it's okay to keep the fees at $250 or whatever they were at that point.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:06:27.280
End: 01:06:41.280
Duration: 14.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:40:50.280
End: 01:41:00.280

Start: 01:41:30.280

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:43:08.280

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 01:43:38.280

Speaker_1:
Start: 01:48:10.280

Text: Having spent six years running the small business development center office here in Manhattan, I can tell you that that's a challenge that this community has is if you're a small business here in entrepreneur, if you're not from here and don't have an existing large existing network here, it's sometimes hard to know where to go.

Text: And so by working with Spark and creating that central hub and then having Spark work with the different resource providers and the others in the community that are part of that entrepreneurship development or the entrepreneurial ecosystem development, that's going to pay a lot of dividends down the road because people are going to be able to access resources quicker and more efficiently.

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:31:24.280
End: 03:31:31.280
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:31:31.280
End: 03:31:35.280

End: 03:32:02.280
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:05.280
End: 03:32:14.280
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Second is to come up with some relocation incentives working with local employees because one of the problems in attracting people here is you got to move.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:14.280
End: 03:32:20.280
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:20.280

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:40.280
End: 03:32:47.280
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Fourth point would be to coordinate with a community development to rejuvenate existing housing.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:47.280
End: 03:32:51.280

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:32:57.280
End: 03:33:09.280
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And it looks to me like with newer rental properties and apartments coming on board in the higher density that we're doing that some of the older homes that have been converted for years to rentals are starting to fall off the market.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:33:09.280
End: 03:33:24.280
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And people are going to want to sell them. Well, perhaps those can now be turned back into single family homes and would help us with getting retirees or new students that graduate to get a job to buy a house in town.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:33:24.280
End: 03:33:37.280
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And then the fifth one is a little bit more open-ended. And I would just say examine best practices on affordable housing initiatives and recommend to the City Commission specific solutions to implement.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:33:37.280
End: 03:33:45.280
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And that goes into all the things. If you look on other city websites, they get housing trust funds and all kinds of various things.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:33:45.280
End: 03:34:00.280
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And I would just leave that open. And I'd like to see the board get put in place quickly because essentially they can hash out these five points and come up with a plan so that they're ready to hit the ground running when the money starts coming in.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:34:00.280
End: 03:34:09.280
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Because the funding is going to drive what they're capable of doing. And I think it take over a year probably to flesh out the five points I make.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:34:09.280
End: 03:34:21.280
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: But that's how I envisioned it when we put it up for vote on the sales tax. It's got to be focused on on the economic development end of workforce housing.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:34:21.280
End: 03:34:29.280
Duration: 8.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 03:35:14.280
End: 03:35:38.280
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: But I do want to think we could provide some kind of incentives somehow to, yeah, first time homeowners or some incentive to the problem is if like the city would start buying a rundown house or something and then putting somebody into it or something then someone's still going to have to pay the rent on the thing.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 03:35:38.280

City Manager:
Start: 03:36:23.280
End: 03:36:44.280
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: But yeah, I don't want the city feeling like they're interfering in the free market too much. But I think there's a lot of these other things with rental inspections and things like that are really a separate issue than what our housing advisory board main, main issue.

City Manager:
Start: 03:36:44.280
