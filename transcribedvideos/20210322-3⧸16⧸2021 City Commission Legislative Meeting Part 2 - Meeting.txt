Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:53:48.520

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:54:10.520

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:54:35.520
End: 00:54:58.520
Duration: 23.000 seconds

Text: And so looking at everything, she came to the conclusion that 16 May, you know, was the best date, and it does allow us to mirror it. And I'm not particularly a fan of, you know, mass ordinances, but what I think that giving all the options and all the different attitudes about this, that this is probably the best compromise that we can come up with, because it does support the university, it supports the school system.

Call the Edminton people. And I'm sure that, you know, they will address it. There's a, there's a administrative line because that is something that's always troubled me.

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:07:50.520

Text: All those have kind of been the conversation that's still circulating out there but then also we were going forward last March with the housing study again the first one or the next one we would do since 2000 but we put that on hold because we saw there's going to be a large community input to that and did not want to advance that study during the COVID pandemic and so we put that on hold.

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:21:57.280
End: 01:22:08.280

Text: We do want to do the housing study so we can generate some updated data even use the consultant support to give us some solutions if you have looked back at the 2000 study there's a lot of detail in that housing study that went so far as to even highlight the number of housing units for apartments.

Duration: 18.000 seconds

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:22:44.280

Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: Also when you think about a housing study thinking about what we got back in 2000 can be anywhere from 60 pages to other communities have 200 page documents for housing study because one provides a lot of market information it gives you a mix of what your housing stock is but it also talks about what are some solutions based upon different demographics based upon different housing needs in your community so it really gives us a bunch of data.

City Manager Jason Hilder:

Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: We did have the RFP ready to go last year we have it out again that we want to review see if we can get that on the street soon and see if we can take the 12 to 15 month process that we see the housing studies anticipated to take to come back again with this 60 to 200 page document whatever it may be that the consultant would come up with.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:23:31.280
End: 01:24:00.280
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So that's one distinct effort we also view the housing advisory board as a distinct effort where we need to come up with the purpose the size the composition and then as we talked about it your last meeting what is kind of the expertise we want on there some practitioners those who work in housing issues every day some may be having housing advocates some who experience different types of housing and so then what is the ultimate role the housing advisory board is it the information you want from them in recommendations on how to tackle some solutions to housing issues.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:24:01.280
End: 01:24:15.280
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So we want to talk about the issues in our community once we better understand what those are from the housing study and then again our conversation particularly from the Chamber of Commerce and others was we now have a workforce housing initiative.

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:24:15.280

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:24:22.280
End: 01:24:33.280
Duration: 11.000 seconds

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:24:33.280
End: 01:24:49.280
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And so as we were thinking about these three distinct efforts going forward it made us rethink a little bit did we have our order right as we're going forward should you create the housing advisory board first not having the data and information to be informed from the housing study.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:24:49.280
End: 01:25:01.280
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Or should we go ahead and try to do everything kind of concurrently and would you expect a housing advisory board that you create to be able to tackle and have the expertise on these merely to issues.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:25:01.280
End: 01:25:18.280
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And so actually going back through this our thought is let's rethink this and let's lead make sure we leave it to housing study like I said we're about ready we need to read through the RFP RFQ to find the right consultant to understand that we do want some different information and what we wanted a year ago.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:25:18.280
End: 01:25:29.280
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: We do want some information about workforce housing initiatives we would actually like some more information if a consultant has some thoughts about what is a housing advisory board even look like.

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:25:29.280
End: 01:25:36.280

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:25:56.280
End: 01:26:11.280
Duration: 15.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:26:11.280
End: 01:26:21.280
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And so one idea could be we had planned with the RFQ for the housing study to have a steering committee with the housing study.

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:26:21.280
End: 01:26:25.280

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:26:38.280

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:26:48.280
End: 01:26:57.280

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:27:00.280
End: 01:27:14.280
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And then lastly let's do give the workforce housing initiative since it does have a funding stream with it a bit more attention and help us determine the housing study can give us some information to help frame that workforce housing initiative.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:27:14.280
End: 01:27:25.280

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:27:25.280

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:27:30.280
End: 01:27:48.280
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So again, let's kind of rethink this a little bit and make sure that we're given all these different housing issues the right time and attention that we think they need without lumping them all into one and expecting a group of eight to 15 to be the ones who can solve and address all these issues for us.

City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:28:10.280
End: 01:28:25.280
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: As we look at the composition and then the last discussion was well, maybe let's grow that even to 17 members or 18 members also trying to get a sense of what is a right balance to have a group that can work together, address these issues and be their most effective.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Jason Hilder:
Start: 01:28:25.280
End: 01:28:34.280

Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: And if we're having input from the stakeholders that we identified potentially already as types of entities that we'd like to eventually be on advisory board or that would be ideal to get their feedback of what they would like in that RFP, including the chamber, including the work that we're doing.

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:50:52.280
End: 01:51:02.280
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And we're including the workforce housing. We wouldn't want to see another RFP in two years to tell us what workforce housing is for Manhattan.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:51:02.280
End: 01:51:08.280

Duration: 12.000 seconds

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:51:20.280
End: 01:51:37.280
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: I'm open to that. But I think Commissioner Hadisall said by the end of this year there's an advisory board. If the steering committee informs the RFP and then begins to consolidate around the advisory board this summer.

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:51:37.280

End: 01:52:21.280
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: We need to get those two entities. And the way Donna had described parallel process is makes sense to me that you can get the housing advisory board going as as that RFP is out there.

Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Dennis, this is Commissioner Ready. I think if you can send us some kind of a timeline would be good. Because I don't know how long it takes once you push something like a RFQ out to get responses. And then since we have a strategic planning committee going on right now with planning next.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:52:52.280
End: 01:53:04.280
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We gave them six to eight months. And that's a 25 board member steering committee kind of what Donna was saying. So they're kind of leading this throughout the community. And then you have this consult consultancy firm.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:53:04.280
End: 01:53:16.280
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And they're using that as their model for feedback information. And also kind of what we're doing with the diversity task force. So, but I know we're thinking about a smaller group to help with the consultants.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:53:16.280
End: 01:53:26.280
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And I don't know what type of consultants there are if they work with the steering committee like this. And I think that would come with more conversations and research that you do.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:53:26.280
End: 01:53:41.280
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: I do want to see some kind of a timeline. I just don't know how long it takes to collect data. Talk to people. And hopefully this is marked maybe by May or June. There might be some more in person things where they can have more conversations and travel here.

End: 01:54:00.280
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: And if you're going to do this, I would like somebody that's here. You can't just do this with the internet. You need to go out and check out some zoning areas, some areas that are developed some properties and what it looks like and what we need to do better and where we can expand and where there's room for growth.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:54:00.280
End: 01:54:14.280
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And like we said earlier, there isn't much land that we can just go outward in. So I think that I would really like to see a timeline. I think you've heard ideas about where we want to see that by the end of 2023 by 2023. I don't even know which one was going to be here.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:54:14.280
End: 01:54:28.280
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So everybody's going to define their own way like they do every city commission for every pot of money that we have. And so and and we kind of left it vague like that sometimes on purpose because the city commissioners at that time, depending on how things are.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:54:28.280
End: 01:54:34.280
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Ready:
Start: 01:54:34.280
End: 01:54:41.280
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:54:41.280
End: 01:54:54.280
Duration: 13.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:54:54.280
End: 01:55:07.280
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But just for reference to this board, are this commission as a goal at our first retreat as this commission, we had indicated that we were looking towards a housing advisory board.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:55:07.280
End: 01:55:21.280
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And prior to that, you know, there had been a work done to make that happen. So the the effort to get that done has been in existence long before there was a workforce housing fund.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:55:21.280
End: 01:55:30.280
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:55:30.280
End: 01:55:36.280
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:55:36.280
End: 01:55:43.280

Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:55:43.280
End: 01:55:52.280
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Start: 01:59:22.280
End: 01:59:45.280
Duration: 23.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Butler:
Start: 01:59:45.280
