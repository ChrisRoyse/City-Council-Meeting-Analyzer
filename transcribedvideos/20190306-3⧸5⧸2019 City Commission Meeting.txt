Mayor Dodson:
Start: 01:59:43.740
End: 02:00:01.740

Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: It's not the full package of codes that we would use here in town what the statute notes does not include several of the codes that we use here locally so it's a much smoother much cleaner process if we can just apply what we have locally it's the most up to date and the most comprehensive package of of codes there are.

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:00:35.740
End: 02:00:54.740
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: I think some of the things that you look at when you look at the updated codes are things like the recognition of new materials that's one of the reasons codes update regularly is because of new materials that are out almost monthly sometimes construction methods and practices.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:00:54.740
End: 02:01:20.740
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: Things we learn from past disasters and past incidents that all go into those codes being updated to make building safer and really now some of the new codes can actually help with the cost efficiency of some of these projects too because of some of the newer types of materials and methods that they allow.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:01:20.740
End: 02:01:35.740
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So you could take an older code that doesn't recognize any of that new type of construction and wind up with a more expensive project than you could under a newer code that maybe allows for some of that type of thing.

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 02:01:35.740

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:02:09.740
End: 02:02:22.740
Duration: 13.000 seconds

Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 02:03:56.740

Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: But maybe we need to look at some kind of a policy where we pay 50% or maybe we need to look at some guidelines on when do we waive this or is it just across the board if you're some entity that we trust and we're just going to waive your fees because you're going to use your staff to meet other people's needs at the same time.

Text: Well I just want to say this isn't about being anti waiver it's just the compilation of all of them together not just us D383 over a period of a year we we have given so many waivers to so many organizations that it ends up being a lot of money and so when I look at it it's all good faith it's all about partnerships but somebody's paying that bill and I think my hands are going to be a lot of money.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Reddy:
Start: 02:18:11.740

Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So the hesitation is if somebody's asking for a grant that's taxpayer money again but if they're exempting it if we're exempting it then we're paying it again so some of our residents are paying twice for the same function that they should have gotten in some of those areas and that's what I mean by the bond issue so I think when taxpayers approve it that's probably hopefully already in there so we're not trying to waive something just because it's been done or that's just good nature.

Text: I'm sure how we need to do it as far as the partnerships that's going to continue that I think in a community like ours we all work together to make it a successful community but this is just one small part where it builds and builds and builds and we're out like two million dollars if we add up all of the fees that we waived across the board because there are good organizations or whatever else it might be.
