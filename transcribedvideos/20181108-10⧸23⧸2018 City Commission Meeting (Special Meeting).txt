Commissioner:
Start: 02:35:32.780
End: 02:35:55.780
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: And with our current regulations of legal non-conforming use being able to be completely rebuilt, even if it was destroyed 100% our vision of having that as a single family neighborhood would never fully be realized unless that owner chooses to abandon that apartment.

Text: A similar thing happens also. So this isn't just a pick on residential properties. A very similar thing happens with commercial properties. This is south of Fort Riley along the railroad where we have a number of residential properties here and a multi or excuse me, a remnant from many, many decades ago of a mobile home park.

Commissioner:
Start: 02:36:44.780
End: 02:36:57.780

End: 02:37:23.780
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So the use. So in our draft regulations, we have, we really try to spell things out and make it much clearer. I would readily admit our current regulations are a little tough to handle for lay person or even the professionals. So we're trying to make it a little easier.

Commissioner:
Start: 02:37:23.780

Commissioner:
Start: 02:37:40.780
End: 02:37:52.780
Duration: 12.000 seconds

Commissioner:
Start: 02:37:52.780
End: 02:38:09.780
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: And all but three, four had anything other than 50% of the fair market value as a threshold of when that non conforming use should be going away.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:38:09.780
End: 02:38:27.780
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: It's an industry standard. It is a planning community standard that that is how non conforming uses are handled through attrition over time. And we are by far the outlier, not only for the state, but across the country, I would imagine.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:38:27.780
End: 02:38:49.780
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: So considering that, we've proposed this this evening. So to deal with uses, we have proposed a non conforming use permit. We've heard time and time again that property owners and sellers and buyers of non conforming uses want to have paperwork in hand so they can make that transaction easier.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:38:49.780
End: 02:39:05.780
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So what we've proposed is a permit where the use in question, so let's pretend it is a threeplex in an R1 single family residential district. They want to have the paperwork to say that it is non conforming.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:39:05.780
End: 02:39:34.780
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: So they would apply for permit with community development department. They would submit evidence and I've provided some outline of things that given in that evidence, leases, tax records, building permits, certificate of occupancy, we'd accept affidavits, photos as long as their timestamp to determine when that use was established and has it generally remained in its same condition to today.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:39:34.780
End: 02:39:52.780
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So we would evaluate the zoning and other rules changed around it. We would evaluate it, community development department would evaluate it, the regulations state that the zoning administrator handles a lot of it, which is a destiny from from Eric as community development director.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:39:52.780
End: 02:40:01.780
Duration: 9.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:40:01.780
End: 02:40:20.780
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: That evaluation will look at all the evidence submitted. We also to verify what's in that building or in that use will require a site and interior inspection from our code and zoning inspector.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:40:20.780
End: 02:40:33.780
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So you remember right, those two forces were separate several years ago, now they have joined forces so we have one person inspecting both code as well as zoning issues.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:40:33.780
End: 02:40:56.780
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: That is not intended to be a full blown code, building code and life safety inspection, but rather just to verify that if they say three units and each unit has two bedrooms, one bath, one kitchen, that inspector will go in to ensure that that's truly what's there and verifying that.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:40:56.780
End: 02:41:15.780
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Now obviously as a representative of the city, if they see some plain site violations, no smoke alarms or windows broken out, I don't know what a Dregist plain site kind of violations they may see, they'll obviously handle that.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:41:15.780
End: 02:41:34.780
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Most generally it'll be a separate process so we don't muddy the water between between trying to determine if the use is not conforming and dealing with a code violation, but they can certainly go hand in hand if there are reasons to.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:41:34.780
End: 02:41:55.780
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: Sorry, then from there that zoning administrator will make the termination if the property owner doesn't like that determination they can certainly appeal to the board of zoning appeals and submit their evidence to get their final approval and then from there it'll be non conforming or illegal.

Text: Can't we just take out that piece that says if we establish you as non-conforming and you don't make any changes there's no reason for us to go back and reinvest to get you if that makes them feel more whether that permit is still absolute or not if it makes them feel more comfortable it makes it feel more absolute I mean I can understand where Mr. Hill is coming from when he says those things so even if the law legally says this is an absolute I think at least from a city perspective we could say our determination.
