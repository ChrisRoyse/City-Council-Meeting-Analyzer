Deputy City Manager Jason Hilgers:
Start: 01:28:23.800

Text: When it comes to industrial revenue bonds but you're right the city takes no risk the property does go into our name metal arcs still in our name portions of GTMs telling our name because when you get into IRBs it transfers until all that debt is paid and then transfers back to that owner so from a taxing perspective our name shows up on these properties but it's a relationship through the duration of that debt service.
