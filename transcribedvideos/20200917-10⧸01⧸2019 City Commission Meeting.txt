Commissioner:
Start: 00:21:08.240
End: 00:21:23.240
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: The only thing that I'll tack on to that is my I'm pretty sure the public has given the city feedback and repeated different forms and different needs assessments that have shown consistently that affordability and quality housing are some of the biggest issues in Manhattan.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:21:23.240
End: 00:21:37.240
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So I think we know what we need to do. So even though that my time is fleeting on the commission, one of the things I'm still pushing for is a discussion of rental inspections, which we haven't had only two commissioners right now have indicated to the city manager that they're willing to have that discussion.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:21:37.240
End: 00:21:49.240

Commissioner:
Start: 00:21:49.240

Commissioner:
Start: 00:22:04.240
End: 00:22:09.240

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:22:09.240
End: 00:22:24.240
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so we have a program. It'd be very effective if everybody would just use it. And I've always thought, well, if we have such a big problem with with the condition of our rental housing, then the city manager should get so many calls that he has to hire more code inspectors.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:22:24.240
End: 00:22:40.240
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And that hasn't happened yet. So that's been my position, but I will be at the event the end of the month and I would like to hear comments from everybody on what we can do to improve our rental registration program because there are a couple of tweaks I think that we can put into that to make it better.

End: 00:22:52.240

Commissioner:
Start: 00:22:52.240
End: 00:23:01.240

Commissioner:
Start: 00:29:53.240
End: 00:30:11.240

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:30:11.240
End: 00:30:21.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Commissioner:
Start: 00:30:21.240
End: 00:30:29.240
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:30:29.240
End: 00:30:36.240
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:30:36.240
End: 00:30:43.240

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:30:52.240
End: 00:30:58.240
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:30:58.240
End: 00:31:11.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And I really think the commission should look at that. I mean I realize we have to do the project but I really don't want to lock in the financing tonight because I think you might be able hopefully we'll get some money from FEMA.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:31:11.240
End: 00:31:17.240
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: But what we don't get from them if we take it out of that Metaphab fund, I think that can be used in the pot county side.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:31:17.240
End: 00:31:27.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And we may have to take some out the other one for the Riley County side. But I believe that would help us a lot in long term budgeting and not run up the city dead hire.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:31:31.240
End: 00:31:46.240
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: I mean I think that could be a potential option for you to consider. At this point our goal is just to authorize some temporary finance like we do with temp notes and then make a determination about whether or not that's the way we want to permanently fund it.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:31:46.240
End: 00:31:59.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Or we want to use other mechanisms to fund it. So I don't think we need to make that decision tonight. But I think from we'd like the flexibility to be able to issue some temp notes to cover our costs at least at this point.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:31:59.240
End: 00:32:10.240
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And then you know after we go through the FEMA process for reimbursement we can kind of see what the Delta is and go from there.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:32:10.240
End: 00:32:22.240
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Okay as long as it comes back so we can decide how it's going to be funded because obviously it's a no brainer. We got to fix the road and the sinkholes. But the funding I don't want to see the city dead go up any higher.

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:32:33.240
End: 00:32:47.240
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: But we're also going to do some work on some of the bank that was washed out long while cat Creek to repair that because the rock got washed out so going to be about $14,000 put into repairing that so the channel stays straight.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:32:47.240
End: 00:32:56.240
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And then the four stream gauges are being financed again and of course they're absolutely vital because it gives us warning that we've got a rise in the creek coming down.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 00:32:56.240
End: 00:33:13.240
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So when you look on the consent agenda and then people are saying a city's not doing anything about flooding. If you had the you know the item on the levy we've actually got four consent agenda items that are basically taking city funds and addressing this problem with flooding.

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:55.240
End: 00:55:13.240
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So something that we're very proud of and you can see in 2002 when Evange Manhattan started that that funding from the private sector has continued to rise through that process, which has allowed us to increase our programming without asking for additional funds.

Text: As I mentioned the last time, one of the things you notice and I'm having spent some time in Norman, the cities that are closer to major metropolitan areas tend to not have to fund a lot of their efforts to the same level as standalone cities.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:52.240
End: 00:56:03.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:03.240
End: 00:56:10.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:10.240
End: 00:56:18.240
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:18.240
End: 00:56:24.240
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:24.240
End: 00:56:29.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:29.240
End: 00:56:39.240

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:39.240
End: 00:56:49.240

Start: 00:57:02.240
End: 00:57:06.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:06.240
End: 00:57:17.240
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:17.240

Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:54.240

Start: 00:58:02.240

Text: Well I don't want to presuppose anything. I think just that talk about that thanks specifically is that's a branding to me that's a branding strategy on their part Tulsa did it two years ago and I know the Tulsa Chamber chair really well and a lot of the things they talked about is yeah they think they're going to get some people to move there but they got huge national publicity because they were doing this process.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:13:41.240

Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: That's a branding strategy right so potentially you come back and say hey we have we have this idea to do this kind of unique branding strategy that's part of that that maybe you do see something like that but but I I'm skeptical of the actually the effectiveness of that I can tell you we're not going back into the same way of doing business though because it's just not effective anymore I mean things have changed and so we have to make sure we're addressing talent and entrepreneurship and our existing business attraction gets a lot of the attention.

Text: Okay so maybe it is how you come back and report back to the commission because since my two years on the commission literally the only interaction I've had on economic development has to do with the attraction of businesses other than maybe the one time that I'll try CE came here and we did an expansion which I think is great.

Text: So on and again it might just be because it's very early on and you kind of said that you wanted to meet with some local entrepreneurs but kind of the same question related to the entrepreneur side of it I got I got asked to judge the start of MHK and we did our practice pitches last week and there were five or six businesses that I probably would have wrote checks to if I had a lot of money in my bank account right there thought on my head like what are we doing help these help these company how do you come back to us to say you know this is what we're doing.

Text: And now there's a contest to do that but it's hard for an agency person or a chamber or a government official to say hey here's all these great entrepreneurship ideas you know without consulting with and talking to entrepreneurs at the same time we didn't really want to sit down and say hey here's some money we can spend when we didn't have the money to talk about it.

Text: I guess my incentive or my kind of feedback on this moving forward is I was still on the commission January what I would want to hear is I have very little care at this point on the leads numbers because at least the two years I have been on the commission that has been an ineffective or at least from my position an ineffective means

End: 01:17:41.240
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: You know what are the specifics it's a lot of money you know over five years and so you know I have to agree it to me it looks soft and I've been on the commission since 2011 and I've seen a lot of ups and downs we've attracted companies and some have gone bankrupt in fact a number of gone bankrupt and some have done well they brought their workforce up and then now it's contracted and it's gone back down.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:17:41.240

Text: And people ask me this they say okay you poured all this money into economic development but my property taxes keep going up and our sales taxes keep going up and the city budget keeps going up and the only thing we've achieved with economic development is we did drive down the city debt maybe because we devoted a third of the last one to debt reduction.

Text: I'm having a hard time answering those questions so that's why I'm throwing them out to you and that's what citizens are telling me what are we getting out of this the guy that's out here that actually lives in a house what is he getting out of it and they don't see the return.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:18:15.240
End: 01:18:30.240
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so I would think that you know if I was going to put a metric together it would be here is how we improved your sales tax receipts here is how we built more buildings and businesses that increased property tax not assessments people don't want their assessments to go up.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:18:30.240
End: 01:18:55.240
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: There's been new building and if we could do those two things as a metric you could sell it because people could see the return and I've been saying that since 2011 every time the chamber brings I've been should hate where does this tie in to the meat and I see these numbers that come up here but to me I would say those numbers are fictitious I don't see it in the city budget and I've been here since 2011 fighting the city budget.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:18:55.240
End: 01:19:17.240
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: Well so I think fair statements but I would I think I think an alternate view of that could potentially be that you've had reductions in students you've had reductions in a number of other areas that if you didn't have some of the economic development that took place instead of having flat revenues you'd have declining revenues.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:19:17.240
End: 01:19:36.240
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So I think potentially that that's it's a little unfair to say there's no return when we know we know for a fact that we've these projects have come forward and we know for a fact that they have an impact they will have an economic impact on the city's budget as well as the other local governing bodies budget.

Start: 01:19:36.240
End: 01:19:46.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Start: 01:19:46.240
End: 01:20:04.240
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: We have no problem at all tracking I mean that's part of the reason that we set these are our goals we're going to create jobs and we're going to attract investment and we're going to report those regularly and if we're not there then we need to have a conversation and figure out why we're not making progress there.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:20:04.240

Text: The other thing I would say is that in terms of investment into the actual programming of economic development Manhattan the city of Manhattan has not contributed to the level of a lot of other cities around us.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:20:21.240
End: 01:20:41.240
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: So again going back to what we discussed earlier that because we've had the private sector contribute to the amount that they have in this community to date that a lot of those achievements in economic development have actually come at a greatly reduced cost to the community than what that might have been in other cities.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 01:20:41.240
End: 01:21:06.240
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: I think the private investments outstanding I have absolutely no problem with that I think that's great but when people still don't see that return I mean what they're saying is when you say the city is not investing the taxpayers voted the economic development fund in place and that's all they were willing to do and fortunately that was a pretty good vote about 60% I think supported it and I hope it gets renewed.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:21:06.240
End: 01:21:34.240
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: But the problem is until we can translate that into the areas I've been talking about sales tax receipts property taxes actual buildings actual jobs and it can't be a case like some of the companies here had goals we gave them money they brought in 250 people now they got 150 working there because they had down trends just like you mentioned things happen in business you got a lay folks off just like full Riley deploys.

Text: K state doesn't recruit students ensure that impacts it but I just want to see a bigger return and for that reason I really don't support saying hey we're going to give you this money for five years I could maybe see doing it for one and using one of the old economic development funds to do it simply because that money can't be used for anything else can't fix the sinkholes and everything else with that necessarily some of its fence and so maybe a year and say okay come back and demonstrate.

End: 01:23:03.240
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: You know because of different things and I think you know we got enough 1.9 million in these two older funds and we got six million in the one now so you know we could risk a year and say okay let's see what you can do but if there isn't some real hard not soft numbers that we can really pin the rows on.

Text: And one other thing I'll pass on one individual sent me an email leave him unnamed talking about specifics on attracting people and his suggestion was sort of like what Commissioner McGee mentioned that Topeka was doing to attract people and we're always trying to focus on the military and his suggestion was a one to create a program that says okay we want retired military people to come and live in Manhattan and our incentive is will give you a tax abatement on your property tax for 10 years.

Start: 01:25:07.240

Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: It won't go up it'll stay fixed I don't know what the legalities of that are if we could actually do it but you know to me that made a lot of sense because if you could attack that retired market the problem is they're not going to overload our schools because the kids are probably already old enough maybe they go to K state that's a plus.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:25:25.240

Commissioner:
Start: 01:25:38.240
End: 01:25:54.240
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So I think that may be a way to go and I can say that's one of the reasons I'm retired here I fit that bill I would like to have a property tax abatement but that's probably not going to happen and we couldn't grandfather it for people that were already here anyway he would be an incentive for new folks just like direct TV and all the room.

End: 01:45:15.240

Commissioner:
Start: 01:47:07.240
End: 01:47:35.240
Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: But it's hard to kind of move forward with uncertainty about resources I totally understand and that's not to say that Christy and yourself haven't had a tremendous impact and I realize there was outside forces causing some of that but with that being said when we fund social services every year one of the things that the advisory boards look at is there was torn turnover leadership they didn't produce the same results that they did and we don't usually cut them a break.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:47:35.240
End: 01:48:00.240
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: We usually cut funding from them a little bit and so as a person who's allocating taxpayer funds I'm going to hold your feet to the same fire and so it's not that I'm against economic development money I just I want us to be more aggressive and some of those other items I want some more metrics tied to tracking but I'll buy into the fact that this is foundational money needed to get to that place.

Text: I think what Jason is starting to show is that the agreement certainly suggests that is a five year commitment because it's it's kind of what are the what are the amount of funds that we can contribute to this effort and to this strategic plan that that certainly we've been a part of but obviously you can't bind future commissions in that regard but I think that's a good thing.

Commissioner:
Start: 01:50:33.240

Text: Just a really a recap of the July work session and some of the items we discussed and some of the comments that I received from the commission at that time and for more information.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:07:48.240
End: 02:08:05.240
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So just a quick summer on the water in July when I presented an update through June at that time, we were obviously projecting to be short on water revenues with the hopes that maybe we'd have a nice dry hot summer.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:08:05.240
End: 02:08:14.240
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: That obviously didn't work out to our advantage for generating revenues. So through August, we're still 22% down from average.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:08:14.240
End: 02:08:39.240
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: As far as you know, water sales provided some numbers here about where we generally projected the 2019 budget for units sold and where we're at now or where I estimate that we're going to be by the end of the year based on numbers through August plus adding comparable numbers from the final quarter last year.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:08:39.240
End: 02:08:50.240
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So right now we're projecting to be about a million dollars short and water revenue. Now that's not good, but at least on the water fund, we're able to absorb that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:08:50.240
End: 02:09:01.240
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So our recommendation is to continue with that 5% planting increase that was proposed with that three year rate rate phasing from the cost of services study.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:09:01.240
End: 02:09:11.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So on the wastewater side, just recap about what we saw in July or work session and where we're at now.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:09:11.240
End: 02:09:23.240
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So of course, we talked about the winter quarter average declining between 2018 and 2019. We declined 2.3% as far as the consumption of residential sewer.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:09:23.240
End: 02:09:34.240
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And since 2015, we saw about an average of 2.6% decrease every year even though we have a slight increase in our customer base.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:09:34.240
End: 02:09:52.240
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Our fund balance that I presented at that time was if you look at the bottom line, that's where we stand to be based on current conditions and factoring in an increased general fund transfer that was happened in 2018 to 2019 assuming that continues.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:09:52.240
End: 02:10:10.240
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And then the projected fund balance if we move forward with the recommendation of staff to make a corrective rate change to our minimum charge and unit charge in order to generate an additional million dollars revenue in order to shore up the fund and the fund balance.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:10:10.240
End: 02:10:25.240
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: As we got brought up earlier, what happened this summer with the emergency sewer repairs, what's that are ongoing, the sinkholes, those are exactly the kind of things that we try to plan for and ensure that we have adequate funds.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:10:25.240
End: 02:10:41.240
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: In case there wasn't an option to go and bond this type of project, it would have put us in a pretty bad position for the projected beginning fund balance in 2020, we went from 2 million to 1 million in a hurry.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:10:41.240
End: 02:10:47.240
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So kind of further justify why came to you with this request.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:10:47.240
End: 02:11:07.240
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: So in just to look at 2020 and where all those lines diverge, all of the greenish brown color that then goes up to the right and meets at 2025 is essentially adding a million dollars a year as you put on the other side.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:11:07.240
End: 02:11:23.240
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And of course, there's some assumptions to go along with that that we don't have a drastic change in and when a quarter average again, we projected, we changed our projections in the future to accommodate a minus 1% growth and consumption.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:11:23.240
End: 02:11:35.240
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So that factors in roughly 2 and a half percent decline in the winter quarter average plus slight growth and commercial and slight growth and residential as far as the number of customers.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:11:35.240
End: 02:11:42.240
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So that's our attempt to be a little more conservative with how we project revenues in the future.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:11:42.240
End: 02:11:51.240
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And of course, you know, barring any significant deviations from our CIP or items such as that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:11:53.240
End: 02:12:10.240
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So it's a recap of our recommendations and what I just stated that making a corrective rate change in addition to what was proposed by the cost of services study that three year phase and a 5%.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:12:10.240
End: 02:12:20.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So and then the information about that minus minus 1% future consumption projections.

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:12:21.240
End: 02:12:27.240
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: At the time, you just to provide a simple scenario of how we could generate that additional revenue.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:12:27.240
End: 02:12:47.240
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: I provided a 50 50 split between generating that additional revenue from the minimum charge, which is a revenue that's meant to offset fixed costs and then sharing the other 50% of that with the unit charge, which is intended to capture revenue to offset variable costs.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:12:47.240
End: 02:12:56.240
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So at that meeting, you should commissioner ready asked for some additional impacts to customers.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:12:56.240
End: 02:13:02.240
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And I think there's a general consensus that we wanted to see more scenarios.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:13:02.240
End: 02:13:06.240
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: So what I did is I provided, I was asked to provide three scenarios.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:13:06.240
End: 02:13:20.240
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Of course, scenario A is what I already provided in scenario B and C are basically the opposite sides of those where scenario B 25% of that additional revenue would come from the minimum charge 75 from the unit charge.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:13:20.240
End: 02:13:26.240
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then scenario C is just the inverse of that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:13:26.240
End: 02:13:34.240
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So I've got some numbers there that show what those impacts would be in 2020.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:13:34.240
End: 02:13:44.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Again, I want to reiterate that we have a 5% proposed increase for 2020 just on the recommendation of the cost of service study.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:13:44.240
End: 02:13:54.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And these two columns over here represent the increase that it would take to generate that million dollars of revenue for each scenario.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:13:54.240
End: 02:14:01.240
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So we end up with these minimum charges and unit rate charges for a month of basis over here.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:14:05.240
End: 02:14:14.240
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Have you considered lowering your expectation from 5% to 3% or something less?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:14:14.240
End: 02:14:24.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Well, so from here on out, the intention was to have a more moderate rate increase every year, 3% over.

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:14:24.240
End: 02:14:26.240

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:14:27.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:14:30.240
End: 02:14:35.240
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: Well, that was just the three year phase in every year was 5% after that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:14:35.240
End: 02:14:43.240
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so for 2020, we're going to keep that 5%, but on top of that, whatever we need to do to generate that additional revenue.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:14:43.240
End: 02:14:48.240
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:15:19.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:15:24.240
End: 02:15:39.240
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And generally what you'll notice here is that obviously scenario A, when you're splitting it, you're still going to impact that lower, lower volume customer more, the customer that has the least ability to forward.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:15:39.240
End: 02:15:47.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:15:47.240
End: 02:15:56.240

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:16:19.240
End: 02:16:27.240
Duration: 8.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:16:27.240
End: 02:16:37.240
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:18:33.240
End: 02:18:39.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:18:46.240
End: 02:18:55.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:18:55.240
End: 02:18:59.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:19:02.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:19:28.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:19:38.240
End: 02:19:47.240

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:19:47.240

Commissioner:
Start: 02:26:22.240

Commissioner:
Start: 02:26:55.240
End: 02:27:04.240

Commissioner:
Start: 02:27:04.240
End: 02:27:10.240

Commissioner:
Start: 02:27:10.240
End: 02:27:16.240

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:27:16.240
End: 02:27:23.240

Commissioner:
Start: 02:27:23.240
End: 02:27:32.240

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:27:39.240
End: 02:28:02.240
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: I mean, we do have to make some choices here. The, as I look at that, I'm comparing, I think I favor A simply because it has some a little bit more assurance because I think B is pretty logical.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:28:02.240
End: 02:28:09.240
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:28:09.240
End: 02:28:22.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But if you look at what we are now for the residential low at $11, then you compare the other three. One is 35, one is 48, and one is 60. So that's kind of the midpoint.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:28:23.240
End: 02:28:44.240
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: But then if I, if you go to the next page and you look at the main campus, for example, at KSU and you go into item B and look down that list, it's essentially for these businesses a 15, 14, 15% increase, which, you know, I know given what's going on at KSU both for the main campus and the housing and dining, that's a lot of money.

Mayor Dodson:
Start: 02:28:44.240
End: 02:29:07.240
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: Same thing for USD $3.3. So I know they're big enterprises, but just from the standpoint of sharing, I think I would come down on kind of a moderate increase on residential and a rather moderate increase on commercial as well, which I think I find today.

And if you look at the trend lines from the years past, I mean, this is just a line that I drew on top of this graph and shows that 2020, you end up almost at that same place where you would have been had you not done that great structure change anyways, we get to the same point almost, we just took a different road to get there.

Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: I think you would have to assume that it does. One of the things we haven't looked at yet and that we want to is how we calculate that one or quarter average and try to, I've looked at other cities and seen some of them do instead of doing December, January, February, they'll do November through February, they'll do December through March.

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:31:01.240
End: 02:31:14.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:31:15.240
End: 02:31:20.240

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:31:20.240
End: 02:31:31.240
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: There are other cities that they look at the daily average and they'll drop off days with zero usage and they'll use that daily average the multiply by 30 and that'll be your winter quarter average.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:31:32.240
End: 02:31:45.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:31:45.240

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:32:13.240
End: 02:32:21.240

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:32:33.240
End: 02:32:46.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And we need to ensure that it's stable because those type of projects are the ones that are going to be going to the state and asking for low interest loans because they're, they're interested in a substantially lower than what we can get from the bonding company.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:32:47.240
End: 02:33:00.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So having a less stable fund puts us at risk for not being able to tame those low interest loans, which I think are very important for us to be able to do those large projects that are needed.

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:33:00.240

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:47:05.240
End: 02:47:19.240
Duration: 14.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_3:
Start: 02:47:19.240
End: 02:47:28.240

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:47:28.240

Start: 02:48:39.240
End: 02:48:52.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: We have an estimate. We think that we're in that ballpark. But, you know, when you're talking about $10 to $15 million of projects in the next three or four years, even if you have a 5% saving, that's a million and a half.

Start: 02:48:52.240

Commissioner:

End: 02:50:37.240
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So everybody's basically paying, you know, for the amount of storm water that they're using. And long term, you know, it would be interesting to look at this development fee, you know, based on, because a lot of people send emails and say, oh, we put in all this, you know, as far concrete and all that.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:50:37.240
End: 02:50:52.240
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: You'd have to vary it on that and they claim that adds to flooding, which it may not at all. But I think that's worth looking at. And then in combination. If that isn't enough, you know, some the increases, you know, the 3% of here, you know, whatever.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner:
Start: 02:50:52.240
End: 02:51:05.240
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Because the only danger on the developmental fee is it might drive down construction. Because now we've kicked in another $1,000 on the cost of doing it. So those got to be balanced. But I would investigate those two.

Speaker_3:
Start: 02:51:49.240
