City Attorney:
Start: 00:29:16.320

Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, absolutely. So that's one of the really, with RHID no matter what, we will have to engage with our bond council at some point, because what they'll do is they'll actually provide us a worksheet to work through to make sure that we're generating enough revenue to pay back whatever it is the RHID is paying for, to make sure that we're generating enough to pay that back.

City Attorney:
Start: 00:30:16.320

City Attorney:

City Attorney:
Start: 00:31:36.320

City Attorney:
Start: 00:31:44.320
End: 00:31:58.320

City Attorney:
Start: 00:32:18.320
End: 00:32:30.320
Duration: 12.000 seconds

City Attorney:
Start: 00:32:30.320
End: 00:32:35.320

City Attorney:

City Attorney:
Start: 00:32:50.320
End: 00:32:53.320

City Attorney:
Start: 00:32:53.320

City Attorney:
Start: 00:32:59.320
End: 00:33:08.320
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: It's a pretty easy, you just went through it again with the LITEQ. It's a pretty easy process where the applicant works with bond council, they draft a resolution, we bring it to you.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 00:33:08.320
End: 00:33:17.320
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And then at the end of the project, you certify that that sales tax exemption. There's no other monitoring after that.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 00:33:17.320
End: 00:33:25.320
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And then kind of in that same vein, by including all rental units, there wouldn't have to be any long term monitoring.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 00:33:25.320
End: 00:33:42.320
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So we would be able to allocate our staff resources in other areas versus having to track down if 10 years after a project or the, is a sales tax exemption that you awarded, is it still for rental units, is it still for workforce housing units.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 00:33:43.320
End: 00:33:55.320
Duration: 12.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 00:33:55.320
End: 00:34:03.320
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 00:34:03.320
End: 00:34:14.320
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So the second aspect here is for the property tax abatement. This would just encourage workforce housing projects that, and the kind of the second component of that is utilizing existing infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------
City Attorney:
Start: 00:34:14.320
End: 00:34:20.320

City Attorney:
Start: 00:35:16.320
