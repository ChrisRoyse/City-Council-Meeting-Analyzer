Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:09:56.000

Start: 00:10:08.000
End: 00:10:23.000

Start: 00:10:23.000

--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:10:37.000
End: 00:10:52.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: The idea here is that we would hire a consultant or consultant team to help the community develop this critical comprehensive housing policy document that will provide us with strategy.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:10:52.000
End: 00:11:03.000

Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:11:03.000
End: 00:11:09.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: We're using the term suitable housing rather than affordable housing or whatnot.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:11:09.000
End: 00:11:36.000
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: So, we're using the broader term to emphasize that we're not just talking about the price tag of a home, but that the house or housing needs include the size, the type, where it's located, those sort of things to address that whole, the whole element of housing.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:11:36.000
End: 00:11:46.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:11:46.000
End: 00:11:57.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:11:57.000
End: 00:12:07.000

Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:12:07.000
End: 00:12:18.000

Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:12:18.000
End: 00:12:36.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And so, what we wanted to do here is use a data-driven approach first to lay out what our problems are and what those issues may be before we dive into possible solutions and those sort of things.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:12:36.000
End: 00:12:59.000
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So, that's really kind of how we've laid this out. The baseline element is to get an understanding of today's housing stock, home sales that are going on today, the demographics, economic indicators, cost of living, those sort of things for the entire region.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:12:59.000
End: 00:13:18.000
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So, I don't have a full, I couldn't explain you exactly what the regions boundaries are. We'll let our consultant that will eventually hire help guide us and frame that for us, but it will be a regional look at what the baseline information is.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:13:18.000
End: 00:13:34.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: We'll then take that information and project out into the future, what our community may look like in terms of demographics and the economy, the homes that we've built or will build, excuse me, based on trends.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:13:34.000
End: 00:13:54.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: So, we know in the future what those needs will be. We anticipate that will be a 20-year projection. Again, we'll rely on the expertise of our consultant team to help us figure that out precisely, but we want to cast a very broad horizon so we can get a full understanding of what's in front of us.
--------------------------------------------------
Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:13:54.000
End: 00:14:06.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And then from there, we'll figure out, all right, if we know we're going to have this many folks and we're only building this many homes, then we have a gap in certain element of our market.

Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:14:06.000

End: 00:14:43.000

Start: 00:14:43.000
End: 00:15:06.000

Chad Bunger, Assistant Director of Community Development:
Start: 00:15:07.000

End: 00:17:04.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds

Start: 00:18:02.000

Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, so it has nothing to do with which fund it comes out of. But in this case, because we are talking about housing, where the pipes are, if they are not adequately sufficient in the infrastructure of the housing, we usually have one of some of our most vulnerable populations in those areas that get flooded.

Mayor Ready:
Start: 01:04:59.000
