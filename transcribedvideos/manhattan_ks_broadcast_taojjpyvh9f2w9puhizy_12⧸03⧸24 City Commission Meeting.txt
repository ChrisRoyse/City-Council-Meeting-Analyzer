Text: That's just my personal opinion. But there is this workforce range in the middle that we've done for a long time that we've been missing on incentives that we need to build targeting housing for.

Commissioner Opel:

Commissioner Opel:
Start: 02:17:15.720
End: 02:17:40.720
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: I think it would be more just like a source of income discrimination clause in the agreement, not saying you have to participate kind of, but you know, if you have someone who is wanting to and able to pay rent with a housing choice voucher, they should be able to.

Mayor Adam:
