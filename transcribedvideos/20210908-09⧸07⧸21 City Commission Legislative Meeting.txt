--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:41:53.240
End: 00:42:19.240
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: So you're just about every year going to exceed the revenue neutral rate because if you don't you can't capture any growth in the city because you'd be sending the same amount of dollars every year and that's what this first part of the public hearing is it's just to say hey we're going to exceed it and when I looked at that requirement it's probably something the city is going to end up doing every year otherwise you're never going to capture any growth.
