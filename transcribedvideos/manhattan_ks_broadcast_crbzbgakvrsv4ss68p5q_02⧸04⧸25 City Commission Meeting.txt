Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Good evening. I'm Kathy Joltausky. I live at 100 South Delaware Avenue and I am concerned about what the mayor just read about this proposed plan to reduce public comment to three minutes from five minutes and to limit overall public comment time given item to 30 minutes.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:02:40.000
End: 00:02:54.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: It really wasn't that long ago. I think it was maybe 2018 that members of the public had unlimited time to speak to commissioners which I can concede perhaps wasn't always the best idea.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:02:54.000
End: 00:03:03.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And they also allowed a single person to come to the podium or the wants which also perhaps wasn't the best idea.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:03:03.000
End: 00:03:13.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So limiting it to five minutes seemed like perhaps a good compromise but I think further reducing it to three minutes starts to feel like you don't really want to hear from the public.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:03:13.000
End: 00:03:23.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And likewise limiting a given item to 30 minutes also is a concern. Most of the time items probably aren't that controversial.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:03:23.000
End: 00:03:32.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: Probably it would be able to be discussed in 30 minutes or less. But on occasion there have been highly controversial items come before this commission.

Member of the Public:
Start: 00:03:32.000
End: 00:03:37.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: I'm going to use rental inspections as an example of one where I think there was a lot of public comment.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:03:37.000
End: 00:03:51.000
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And if public comment was limited to 30 minutes total, well there's the potential of that the first ten speakers all are talking on one side of the issue and the commission doesn't really ever get to hear from people from the other side of the issue.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:03:51.000
End: 00:04:01.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: The other problem I think with that is sometimes when you come to a meeting you aren't necessarily thinking you're going to speak on a given matter because you're not really then concerned about it.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:04:01.000
End: 00:04:10.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: But then somebody says something either by staff or another member of the public and you're suddenly inspired that you want to say something but you didn't sign up ahead of time.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:04:10.000
End: 00:04:25.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And there's already ten speakers that have signed up and so you're just out of luck. And I find that to be kind of a problem that this commission for some reason is afraid to hear from the public doesn't value public input such that they want to limit it.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:04:25.000
End: 00:04:28.000
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: I don't know really what the reason is behind this.

Member of the Public:
Start: 00:04:28.000
End: 00:04:46.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And there was also a meeting not that long ago where an item on the consent agenda I believe it was about the resolution involving parks and recreation was pulled from the consent agenda as it lays out in the agenda consent agenda items removed are supposed to be discussed immediately after the consent agenda.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:04:46.000
End: 00:04:56.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: But instead staff was recommending that it go all the way to the end after the general agenda which again had the sense of feeling like well because we didn't really want to hear from the public.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:04:56.000
End: 00:05:01.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So if we put it at the end of the agenda maybe they'll get worn out and they'll leave.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:05:01.000
End: 00:05:08.000
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And I'm just very concerned about what this message is sending to those of us in the public who would like to speak to the commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Member of the Public:
Start: 00:05:08.000
End: 00:05:17.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And I really don't need to fill two more minutes but I really was trying to fill up five minutes today just because this might be my last chance to talk for five minutes.

Member of the Public:
Start: 00:05:17.000
End: 00:05:26.000
