Commissioner Aaron Estabrook:
Start: 02:21:16.700
End: 02:21:37.700
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: The trellis obviously gives it corner an opportunity to have something in addition to make it a little more green. Those are options that the design team felt like perhaps we would want to explore just given the length and the size and the appearance of this building at that corner.

Commissioner Aaron Estabrook:
Start: 02:21:38.700
End: 02:21:58.700
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: This is what it's proposed to be in the GMP. It's not there's some differences. I think most of the differences are in the upper floors. The lower two floors, it's not unattractive. It's just bringing more plants and more green into that area.

End: 02:22:54.700
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: Both of these projects had bond resolutions associated with them for the design and the construction. The design on parking garage was slightly over a million dollars. We had a bond resolution for that. And then Laramie street, we didn't envision 14th and Anderson in that project authorization resolution.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Aaron Estabrook:
Start: 02:22:54.700

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Aaron Estabrook:
Start: 02:23:31.700
End: 02:23:57.700
Duration: 26.000 seconds
Text: So we have about a $4 to $5 million gap that we anticipate with a garage, half sent sales tax, obviously passing in November, provides us that opportunity to look at this debt service and utilize that revenue stream potentially reminder that 70% that was dedicated towards public infrastructure and debt was about 4.5 million a year for that 10 year period.

Commissioner Aaron Estabrook:
Start: 02:24:53.700
End: 02:25:03.700

Commissioner Aaron Estabrook:
Start: 02:47:54.700
