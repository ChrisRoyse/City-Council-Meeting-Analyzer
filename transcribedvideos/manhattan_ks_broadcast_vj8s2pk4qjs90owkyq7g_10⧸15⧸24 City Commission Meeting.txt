--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:17:21.820
End: 01:17:33.820
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So our story starts about a year ago. Commerce Bank came to us as partners and said we have this building of Manhattan and their long time tenant in the tower was moving out.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:17:33.820
End: 01:17:51.820
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So we would love to figure out a way to redevelop this building. What can we do and how can we reuse this building to prepare it for another 20, 30, 50 years of occupancy.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:17:51.820
End: 01:18:01.820
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And so our team in conjunction with Commerce Bank spent over four months trying to figure out a solution to how to reuse the existing building as it sits today.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:18:01.820
End: 01:18:09.820
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And iteration after iteration and digging through in the tunnel of the old building and everywhere else.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:18:09.820
End: 01:18:20.820
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: What we found is that there is no way we could come back in and redevelop the building as it sits today because of the cost to renovate the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:18:20.820
End: 01:18:26.820
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Some of the things that you may not look at or know just when you look at the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:18:26.820
End: 01:18:34.820
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: They're overall floor plate of the tower is incredibly small. It's only a few thousand square feet. It doesn't feel like it when you drive by the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:18:34.820
End: 01:18:46.820
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: But when you get up and in the building, the tower itself is not a very large structure. Although it's tall from a floor plate. There's just not enough area there to redevelop it into.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:18:46.820
End: 01:18:58.820
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: We looked at both apartments and future offices. Additionally, all the glass on the outside of the building, the entire north face of the building is glass. All the glass needs replaced.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:18:58.820
End: 01:19:07.820
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: It's original to the building. And then also the heating air conditioning system for the entire building needs to be updated and replaced.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:19:07.820
End: 01:19:15.820
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: All those factors in addition to general renovations costs to do an adaptive reuse made the building not feasible.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:19:15.820
End: 01:19:21.820
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And so we went back at great conversations with Commerce Bank and said, we appreciate you guys letting us take a look at this.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:19:21.820
End: 01:19:29.820
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: We don't think that there's an option there for redevelopment. And we kind of thought that the project was going to end there.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:19:29.820
End: 01:19:38.820
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And then Commerce Bank came back a month or two later and said, okay, dream big with us. What could we figure out to do in this place?
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:19:38.820
End: 01:19:45.820
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: On points avenue. I'm a K state grad. Most of our design and construction departments are K state grads as well.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:19:45.820
End: 01:19:52.820
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So when the opportunity came to dream big and say, what could we do in place of this to honor the building that was there.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:19:52.820
End: 01:20:00.820
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: But then also prepare this corner at eighth and points for the next 50 years. Well, we had our team put their heads together.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:20:00.820
End: 01:20:15.820
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And that's when we brought Mike in and said, we think a mixed use development right down on points that blends both commercial space, retail space and housing is a great opportunity or a great future for this corner.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:20:15.820
End: 01:20:29.820
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And so Mike having done a project very similar to this one and incredibly similar floor plate and site plan. So we brought Mike in and we all put our heads together and came up with the building that you saw at the start.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:20:29.820
End: 01:20:37.820
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So what we're proposing to build is this structure at the in place of the existing Commerce Bank building.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:20:37.820
End: 01:20:49.820
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: What it has is first floor all commercial space and retail space. That'll be a mixture. Great partner, Commerce Bank will be in on the first floor if we're able to go build it.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:20:49.820
End: 01:20:56.820
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:21:06.820
End: 01:21:17.820
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And then on the fifth floor, as you see, whatever what we're calling a rooftop patio, it'll be a rooftop amenity space because of the condensed nature of the site and urban redevelopment.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:21:17.820
End: 01:21:24.820
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Oftentimes you don't have the sprawling amenities of clubhouses and pools and everything else because you're more condensed in your downtown.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Mata:
Start: 01:21:24.820
End: 01:21:30.820
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And so that'll be a great amenity space for us up on the fifth floor.
