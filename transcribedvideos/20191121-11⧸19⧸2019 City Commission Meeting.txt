Commissioner Butler:
Start: 00:13:29.500
End: 00:13:36.500

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:52:34.020

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:52:42.020
End: 02:52:47.020
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: It's maybe some side income, but it kind of gives you a perspective of how they are approaching their rental units.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:52:47.020
End: 02:52:50.020
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:03.020
End: 02:53:06.020
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:14.020
End: 02:53:20.020
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then we asked the landlords when they have a vacancy or open unit, how do they advertise?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:20.020
End: 02:53:24.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:24.020
End: 02:53:30.020
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: and so you can kind of see how those numbers shook out, but basically 60% use the website or social media.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:30.020
End: 02:53:34.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:42.020
End: 02:53:49.020
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And so we asked about different ranges of deposits, and so the 75% charge one month rent.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:49.020
End: 02:53:57.020
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:53:57.020
End: 02:54:00.020
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So if you put those two together, that'll give you a sense.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:54:00.020
End: 02:54:03.020
Duration: 3.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:54:07.020
End: 02:54:13.020
Duration: 6.000 seconds

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:54:38.020
End: 02:54:48.020
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And then we asked again, so this was on the flip side we asked about the renters, and if they went through into the walkthrough, we asked the landlords, and they said yes, they do a walkthrough.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:54:48.020
End: 02:54:50.020
Duration: 2.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:54:50.020
End: 02:54:56.020
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then we also talked about some people say the term slum landlords are not maintained their units.

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:54:56.020

Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: We think the conditions aren't up to standard.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:54:59.020
End: 02:55:10.020
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so we really kind of won again, get just what their impression was, and we gave them a range of how many dollars they spent annually to maintain each individual unit, not just as a whole.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:10.020
End: 02:55:18.020
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so you see the responses there, about 58% you take the last two columns there, spent more than a thousand dollars per unit per year.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:18.020
End: 02:55:20.020

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:26.020
End: 02:55:35.020
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: But it at least says overall that the landlords are telling us they are investing some amount in their unit each year.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:35.020
End: 02:55:40.020
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And then we said, are there more renters in the unit than on the lease?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:40.020
End: 02:55:44.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And the landlords said 75% no, there's not.

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:48.020
End: 02:55:52.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And I think you see the similar between what the students said was a landlord's seat.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:52.020
End: 02:55:56.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And then we wanted to just kind of get a sense, our renters being evicted.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:55:56.020
End: 02:56:00.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And so we asked for the last two years how many have they evicted.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:56:00.020
End: 02:56:07.020
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And it said 67% had not had to evict or terminate in the last two years, anyone from their units.

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:56:07.020
End: 02:56:10.020

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:56:10.020

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:56:12.020
End: 02:56:16.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And basically 84% of the renters were evicted for failure to pay rent.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:56:16.020
End: 02:56:18.020
Duration: 2.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:56:18.020
End: 02:56:22.020
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:56:22.020

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:57:22.020
End: 02:57:34.020
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So then we asked one again another general question we thought the commission might be interested in is are there populations in our community who may have difficulty finding sufficient rental housing based upon some of the properties that are in the city code.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:57:34.020

Speaker_1:
Start: 02:58:44.020

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_1:
Start: 02:59:01.020

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morse:
Start: 02:59:57.020

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morse:
Start: 03:00:07.020
End: 03:00:22.020

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 03:00:22.020

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 03:00:58.020
End: 03:01:04.020

Commissioner Morse:
Start: 03:02:03.020
