So traffic with again flowing to the south towards larmy street, no curb, the ability to close off with removable ballards, the street for special events at morrow as well as block the alley headed to the west or from the west there.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:52:11.000
End: 00:52:29.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds

Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:52:30.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:52:43.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:53:49.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 00:54:28.000

Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: On all of these concepts too, we looked at utilizing landscape and landscape features to limit air and cars, protect corners of buildings, being very mindful of turning radius of vehicles as they when they do need to access the alley or if a car maybe worked a veer off of Larmy Street providing some sort of protection zone to prevent damage.

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:01:00.000
End: 01:01:24.000
Duration: 24.000 seconds

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:01:24.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:01:54.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:02:13.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:02:47.000
End: 01:03:05.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:06:09.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:06:37.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:49:17.000
End: 01:49:30.000

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:49:48.000
End: 01:50:03.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so the idea is is for them to go ahead and come down and stage. They're there. And so when somebody makes that decision that, you know, I don't think I'm going to get my car and drive or I, I already had a ride down here. That's how I'm going to do it.

Start: 01:50:03.000

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:50:13.000
End: 01:50:33.000
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: And so the idea of like right now, we know that coming up here before the end of the semester, we're going to do some of that probably on 12th Street, right by Tanners on that side because that's still there's still enough room for for cars both ways there.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:50:33.000
End: 01:50:46.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But on the Tanners side, since they're not really using that as a serving area, that's going to be a temporary ride share spot so people know that they can go there and they can find the ride.
