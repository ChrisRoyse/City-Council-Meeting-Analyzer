End: 00:12:02.840
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Mayor Dodson, Wynn Butler, they spent years serving our country in the US Army, climbing the ranks where they managed thousands of people and budgets much larger than that of the city's commission or Morris who in my opinion is as much of a staple of this community as Bill Snyder is.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:12:02.840
End: 00:12:13.840
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:12:30.840
End: 00:12:45.840
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Also in her spare time she's running for US Senate so she's a busy lady. I just I think she's a perfect example of the American dream and why why it's so important and how immigrants make our cities and our communities and our country so much stronger.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:12:45.840
End: 00:12:52.840
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So to say two years ago when I first got set on this commission that it was kind of intimidating to be around all of these accomplished people would be an understatement.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:12:52.840
End: 00:12:59.840
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: I was really intimidated right but I think during that time they've taught me a great deal and I've hope I've taught them something too.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:12:59.840
End: 00:13:09.840
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So one kind of big point that I want to make with this kind of comment is all these commissioners on this day attend a lot of meetings more than just the meetings that we do on Tuesday night.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:13:09.840
End: 00:13:20.840
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And really early on when I was going to these meetings it became quite evident to me that at 99% of these meetings I was going to be by far the youngest person in the room, by far the youngest person in the room.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:13:20.840
End: 00:13:35.840
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so it got me thinking a lot of why that was. Why are more young people not elected to public office? Why are more young people not a part of the bodies of these organizations that I'm meeting with and why or 20 something's largely left out of these conversations.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:13:35.840
End: 00:13:46.840
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so I thought about that a lot and you know economic and structural issues play into it but I can't be the whole reason right. I'm setting care and I'm fairly poor so I found a way but why is that?
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:13:46.840
End: 00:13:55.840
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And I had a few experiences during my tenure on the commission that I think illustrated why it is and I'll give you a couple here.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:13:55.840
End: 00:14:01.840
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: So first when I first elected the main happened Mercury often when they would write about me would put my age behind my name.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:14:01.840
End: 00:14:10.840
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So they would say Jared McKee comma 25 comma. They would also reference my fellow commissioners and they never put their age in the newspaper.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:14:10.840
End: 00:14:17.840
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Now I don't think the Mercury intended any malice whatsoever when they did this but it was just kind of how it was.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:14:17.840
End: 00:14:28.840
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Also when I tend to meet people for the first time I'll say something along the lines of high my name is Jared McKee and more than 75% of the time people say, oh wow.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:14:28.840
End: 00:14:38.840
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Oh wow you're a city commissioner right. Oh wow. And I'm like yeah I'm not Jared McKee and I would like to think that they're like very surprised by my beauty or something of that nature.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:14:38.840
End: 00:14:51.840
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: But I don't think that's why it is right. I think it's their surprise of how young I am. I think a lot of people knew I was young but they were thinking like 35 to 40 couple kids young not this kids ink on his diploma still wet young.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:14:51.840
End: 00:15:02.840
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so just little things like that then one more thing I went to the Parks and Rec board meeting one time where they were discussing the Warner Park master plan with disc golf and we all know that was a big issue.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:15:02.840
End: 00:15:07.840
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: Here and I went to that meeting because I wanted to see how the board interacted and kind of hear the public comment.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:15:07.840
End: 00:15:13.840
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: I was standing way in the back in the city auditorium not really talking to anybody I just wanted to be there to listen.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:15:13.840
End: 00:15:25.840
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And when the board was about to speak at Clean Mac who's the chair kind of gestured to the back of the room and said to the board, make sure that you fully describe your position because we have a city commissioner and it's and it's just your back at me.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Jared McKee:
Start: 00:15:25.840
End: 00:15:38.840
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And so I had probably had about three dozen people turn around and all make eye contact with me for about a minute and then kept looking for the city commissioner because they're like, it can't be him right like that's not that's not it.
--------------------------------------------------
