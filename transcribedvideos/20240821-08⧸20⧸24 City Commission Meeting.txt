Text: Part of the agreement does state we're still working on the plate as I mentioned and part of that is some drainage requirements. And so there is a provision in there that if those if whatever's needed for drainage comes back and it seems that it's going to require additional incentive from the city that the developer could walk away and the city could also walk away from this.

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Opell:
Start: 00:17:39.000
End: 00:17:51.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds

Commissioner Opell:
Start: 00:18:15.000

End: 00:19:11.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Start: 00:19:11.000

Duration: 15.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Opell:
Start: 00:19:40.000

City Manager:

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:45:46.000

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:46:34.000
End: 00:46:46.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Both of the utilities historically our rating agencies have really appreciated the commission raising rates when they need to in order to maintain that fund balance.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:46:46.000
End: 00:46:57.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:46:57.000

City Manager:
Start: 00:49:10.000
End: 00:49:27.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: This 4% increase is in the budget sheets. It reflects that increase in that $229 million budget. Does that make sense? So in some respects, you are acknowledging the potential, but you can always bring it down.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:49:27.000
End: 00:49:45.000
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And if you want to give guidance that you don't want these increases, we can adjust the budget by the time you adopted in 2017. If you're okay with the 4% just from a budgeting perspective, it doesn't lock you in to that rate. You can actually bring it down or not have any increase at all.
