This is when we actually start working with the developer to specify what are the geographic boundary of that district, what is your development going to look like, how many housing units, what type of housing units, just all of those details that we need to know in order to really have a clear picture of what we're trying to, trying to construct or produce.

City Manager:
Start: 00:52:29.200

Start: 00:57:31.200

Duration: 12.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 00:57:49.200
End: 00:57:58.200
Duration: 9.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 00:57:58.200
End: 00:58:07.200

City Manager:
Start: 00:58:07.200
End: 00:58:16.200
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: At this point our developer developer investment is $30,000. That was for them to buy that lot. And they have no other improvements on it today.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:58:16.200
End: 00:58:19.200

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:58:19.200
End: 00:58:32.200
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So scenario two is just is going to be a market rate development. So there's no sendives. There's no special assessments. This is we're assuming that they're just doing all of this out of pocket.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:58:32.200
End: 00:58:41.200
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So again, they purchase price, but this time that developer had to put in $100,000 of public infrastructure. That could be roads sidewalks, sewer, water.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:58:42.200
End: 00:58:52.200
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And then they ended up building you can envision this to be whatever you would like, but ends up having three different units that are attached and that costs $700,000.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:58:52.200
End: 00:59:08.200
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So we could have let's say their their row houses. So we have our total developer cost of $830,000. After this is done, they get some tenants in there and the average rent on this to make it break even for them is $1900.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:59:08.200
End: 00:59:22.200
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And then you see here in blue our workforce housing target rent. This is just outside of of that. And we so we created no workforce housing units with this just market rate scenario.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:59:23.200
End: 00:59:34.200
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Just a comparison of the numbers if we don't have any incentives there, you see really what we're looking at is this last column, the difference column.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:59:34.200
End: 00:59:47.200
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And if we come down, I highlighted the cities, the city's taxes. So we actually off this project, we this is the amount that we'd be collecting and revenue every year from this housing development going in.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:59:48.200
End: 01:00:01.200
Duration: 13.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:00:01.200
End: 01:00:10.200
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So scenario three, we're going to have a lot that's developed only with RHID, meaning that the developers only going to be getting assistance with the infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:00:10.200
End: 01:00:22.200
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: There's going to be no, no help with the cost of the building construction. So the purchase price I showed it in red suggests that the RHID is paying for that same with public infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:00:22.200
End: 01:00:38.200
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: The building cost was out of pocket for this developer. And so we have our total developer cost because the RHID participated in some of those expenses, they were actually able to lower the average rent to $1,600 a month, which is within our workforce housing range.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:00:38.200
End: 01:00:49.200
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And we've been able to create using the RHID about three workforce housing units. Now this is where we marry RHID and MIH and you can see the improved benefit.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:00:49.200
End: 01:00:59.200
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: I won't run through everything up here other than to say that this developer was awarded 300,000 and MIH for the construction of this building.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:00:59.200
End: 01:01:12.200
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And between RHID and MIH, they were able to offer rent in this building for about $916 a month, which is at the lower end of that workforce housing range.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:01:12.200
End: 01:01:27.200
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So we created again three workforce housing units, but you can see how using those two programs together provides even more benefit to that that intent whoever's residing there.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:01:27.200
End: 01:01:46.200
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: So this just takes all of the different scenarios we went through, really what I would highlight is the rent charged. That was the main difference in each of these, how those different financing programs came together to create an affordable product.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:01:46.200
End: 01:02:00.200
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And then when we look at the property tax impact, we're going to say that this is a 10 year RHID because they were actually able to collect the number or the amount of taxes they needed over a 10 year period to pay for that infrastructure.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:02:00.200
End: 01:02:13.200
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So after 10 years expires, then this amount that you see here, this 150,000, that would actually go back onto the tax role to be again collected by the taxing entities.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:02:13.200
End: 01:02:24.200
Duration: 11.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 01:02:24.200

We got plenty of apartments. We need single family houses, duplex, half duplexes, townhouses, row homes, something that people can get into for less than a couple hundred thousand bucks.

Text: But I feel like this is an opportunity again if we could target some of these dilapidated as one of mentioned buildings and some of what people think is affordable rentals or the ones that are in decrepit condition.

Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: If we could somehow or other target these programs to that so that somebody would buy up a couple of those and then renovate them and put them in a condition which meets the affordable idea, that I think is a good way to attack the problem of these substandard rental properties that have been around for a while.

Text: I would be happy to in this first effort to just give you your head, go develop something that is creative that you think will get passed and let and and have the commission working on the policy in the meantime because we're going to have to go down that path kind of slow.
