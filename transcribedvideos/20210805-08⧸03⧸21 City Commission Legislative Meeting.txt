Start: 01:39:35.040

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:39:44.040
End: 01:39:53.040

Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:41:15.040
End: 01:41:34.040
Duration: 19.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor Butler:
Start: 01:41:34.040

I can say, you know, when we talk about the 11 o'clock cutoff, for example, I would be looking for the permit applicant to be describing some sort of notification or signage as people come in that this event, this open event ends at 11, you know, maybe put it on the wristband that it ends at 11 and that alcohol consumption has to occur inside of business now on the street.
