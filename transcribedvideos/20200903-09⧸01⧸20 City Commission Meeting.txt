And I just wanted you to know that we appreciate the commission's support of our new software called PayLocity that has really been able to help us implement not only our new payroll system, but I can assure you that Tammy could speak for hours if I would letter.

Text: And we have quite a few employees that are not in the USD 383 system there in surrounding communities and the different systems that those schools have employed. But one of the statistics I wanted to share with you as a result of that, we have about 45% of our employees have K through 12 age children.

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:07:01.120
End: 01:07:12.120
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: It was passed in response to the MFRO and UCR district and the commission gave us guidance at that time that routinely they wanted us to methodically go through the UCR.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:07:12.120
End: 01:07:24.120
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And through the MFRO district paved the alley that were gravel or were broken up concrete because those alley serve a different function out when they originally created back in the 1930s 1940s.

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:07:31.120
End: 01:07:43.120
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Today they can easily be three to four hundred vehicles a day because there's several hundred apartment units on to those alley where kids, college kids park and drive up and down the alley.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:07:43.120
End: 01:07:54.120
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: They're also carrying a lot of garbage trucks those heavy trucks that set in the alley and go through the alley and then pick up the trash on the backside of the buildings now.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:07:54.120
End: 01:08:04.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So the goal of the alley paving policy was to pay or repay existing alleys to meet the demands of the additional increased loads traffic loads in the MFRO district.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:08:04.120
End: 01:08:12.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: In 2018 all the alleys in the MFRO district were rated. This alley was actually in the bottom three of those that were rated.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:08:12.120
End: 01:08:21.120
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: The other two one of them has been completed. Another one will be back before you next year. This one actually jumped up or rating because there's so much construction on it.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:08:21.120
End: 01:08:30.120
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: The other two apartments that you've seen along Manhattan have gotten substantially bigger and jumped this one in front of the other.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:08:30.120
End: 01:08:38.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So due to the significant increase that's expected when those M1 and M2 apartments become available this alley now has jumped ahead.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:08:38.120
End: 01:08:42.120
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: So what is the alley paving policy? Well the policy requires four items.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:08:42.120
End: 01:08:52.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: First it must be in the MFRO district. This one is not only in the MFRO district is also in the UCR district which is the heavy use the large department building district.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:08:52.120
End: 01:09:01.120
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: The alley must have more than 32 living units adjacent to it. This one actually has more than 100. We didn't count them but just the M1 and M2 alone is over 100.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:09:01.120
End: 01:09:11.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: There's probably close to 200 on this one. Public meetings of the Jane adjacent owners must be held and this is the one where we had some complications due to COVID.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:09:11.120
End: 01:09:21.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We mailed one set of letters. We asked for some responses. Opportunities set up some meetings. We did hear back from almost everybody in the alley.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:09:21.120
End: 01:09:29.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: We either talk to them or they're representative. After that first round we mailed out another round of letters just to make sure everybody got their comments heard.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:09:29.120
End: 01:09:39.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: We did hear back from some more people then. Really that the discussion hinged on nobody disagrees with the condition of the alley. The alley is in poor condition.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:09:39.120
End: 01:09:52.120
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The discussion is we think that the city should pay for all of it. Unfortunately that's not what the policy says so I can't make that recommendation to you. It has to go through the public hearing process.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:09:52.120
End: 01:10:00.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So what is the district? Well with the public hearing district the district is set by the area method of assessment. So the bigger your lot is the more you're going to pay.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:10:00.120
End: 01:10:10.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Which is actually kind of advantageous in this case because the two largest apartment buildings are going to end up paying for half. Half of the total alley are in the two new apartments.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:10:10.120
End: 01:10:21.120
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: The other seven or eight lots are going to divide that other half. So there's no single family properties on this alley. They're all rentals.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:10:21.120
End: 01:10:29.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And while we're doing some alley work we're also going to do some stormwater improvements like we did in the last alley in the 1100 block.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:10:29.120
End: 01:10:37.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Because those alleys now not only function as the main transportation and trafficway they also carry a vast majority of the stormwater.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:10:37.120
End: 01:10:44.120
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Almost all of these buildings shed water to that alley that alley carries that water to 11th Street into North Manhattan.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:10:44.120
End: 01:10:50.120
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And then it runs down the gutter eventually gets them to an inlet. We're going to capture that water early and we're going to get it underground early.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:10:50.120
End: 01:10:56.120
Duration: 6.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 01:10:56.120
End: 01:11:04.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So what did this alley look like? Well 2013 pictures here you can tell it's not in real great shape.

City Manager:
Start: 01:11:04.120

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:11:25.120
End: 01:11:35.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: Again the stormwater that collects in the alley and just doesn't go away. This water eventually gets down to the subgrade and just deteriorates and subgradives.

City Manager:
Start: 01:11:35.120

Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: 2019 this is what it looks like today. You can see the M1, M2 apartments in the background. Here's what the alley looks like today.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:11:46.120
End: 01:11:56.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So again I don't think there's a lot of discussion or a lot of opposition to the condition of the alley. The question is who should pay for it.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:11:56.120
End: 01:12:04.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Again here's that condition of that alley here and here. This would be looking east. This would be looking west.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:12:04.120
End: 01:12:14.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So what is the proposed district? Well the M1 and M2 apartments. This is M2. This is M1.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:12:14.120
End: 01:12:23.120
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: These two would actually pay for half of the cost. So these two are paying for half and the other one two three four five six are dividing 50%.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:12:23.120
End: 01:12:34.120
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So the M1 and M2 estimated payments. M1 this one about $178 a month. I believe there's about 30 or 40 apartment buildings in there.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:12:34.120
End: 01:12:38.120
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:12:38.120
End: 01:12:46.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: M2 is 297 a month. This one. I don't know the count on how many apartments are in there. All I know is it's huge.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:12:46.120
End: 01:12:56.120
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And so when you divide a large number you know by that $397. You're probably in that $5 to $6 a month per bedroom again.

Start: 01:13:05.120
End: 01:13:13.120

Text: I never did get an opportunity to speak with their attorney directly. We just never touch base. But we did converse a little bit back and forth.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:13:13.120
End: 01:13:21.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And they're concerned with the same as everybody else that we don't disagree with the condition. We just don't think that property owners should pay for it.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:13:21.120
End: 01:13:29.120
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So the Wayne Family Trust has these four lots here. You're looking at roughly $60 a month for the two smaller lots.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:13:29.120
End: 01:13:39.120
