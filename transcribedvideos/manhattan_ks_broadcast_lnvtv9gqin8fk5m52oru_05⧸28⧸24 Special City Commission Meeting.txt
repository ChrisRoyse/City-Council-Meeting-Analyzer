--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:11:09.000
End: 00:11:15.000
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And so the software is with Oracle and that is a non capitalizable cost.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:11:15.000
End: 00:11:26.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so we are saying that we would pay cash for that in 2024 is that annual amount and then 2025 to 2028 are the other annual amounts.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:11:26.000
End: 00:11:36.000
Duration: 10.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:11:36.000
End: 00:11:49.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: In terms of implementation this would be part of Creole services and so they have costs that we consider implementation, training, data conversion, travel.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:11:49.000
End: 00:12:05.000
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: And then yes those are the categories and so those that say cash those are the ones that are not capitalizable meaning we would not be able to add them to our financials and appreciate that out.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:12:05.000
End: 00:12:09.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: And then we also wouldn't be able to finance that with temporary notes.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:12:09.000
End: 00:12:21.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And then the last portion of that is the GFOA advisory services so those would be additional implementation services to ensure that we are meeting all of our deliverables.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:12:21.000
End: 00:12:26.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And so then that total for 2024 is 2.5 million dollars.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:12:26.000
End: 00:12:38.000
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And so throughout the year and those 10 months that Jared had mentioned we will have these deliverables and milestones and we would have to make those payments their flat fixed fees.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:12:38.000
End: 00:12:43.000
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And then travel is on a reimbursement basis so it's up to that amount.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 00:12:43.000
End: 00:12:58.000
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So this would be the amount pending your approval of the first reading of the ordinance that we would actually pay cash and use our funds for 2024 and then the balance would be that we could issue temporary notes for.

Mayor Adam Check:
Start: 00:12:58.000

--------------------------------------------------
Department Head:
Start: 00:25:50.000
End: 00:25:54.000
Duration: 4.000 seconds

Department Head:
Start: 00:25:54.000
End: 00:26:05.000
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Department Head:
Start: 00:26:05.000
End: 00:26:12.000

--------------------------------------------------
Department Head:
Start: 00:26:12.000
End: 00:26:19.000

Department Head:
Start: 00:26:19.000
End: 00:26:23.000

Department Head:
Start: 00:26:23.000
End: 00:26:32.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: We could figure out are there changes that we're wanting to make, are we wanting to continue on with some of these, most likely the workforce housing sales tax will extend beyond this three years,
--------------------------------------------------
Department Head:
Start: 00:26:32.000

Department Head:

Department Head:
Start: 00:26:42.000

End: 00:27:15.000
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: I think the biggest aspect, you'll hear me reference it several times tonight, I will sound like a broken record by the end of this, is that the more that we dive into some of these policies and programs and talk to our peer communities, they've all heavily relied on external experts to help guide them through this process.
--------------------------------------------------
Department Head:
Start: 00:27:15.000
End: 00:27:24.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Department Head:
Start: 00:27:24.000

Department Head:
Start: 00:27:46.000
End: 00:27:54.000

Department Head:
Start: 00:27:54.000
End: 00:28:03.000
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Department Head:
Start: 00:28:34.000

Department Head:
Start: 00:28:44.000

Department Head:
Start: 00:29:04.000
End: 00:29:17.000
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And then lastly, as I already kind of mentioned, at the end of the three years, we'd go back, we'd reevaluate, we'd bring to your report, this is how many units we did, this is, these are how many projects we funded under these programs.
--------------------------------------------------
Department Head:
Start: 00:29:17.000

Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, absolutely. So that's one of the really, with RHID no matter what, we will have to engage with our bond council at some point, because what they'll do is they'll actually provide us a worksheet to work through to make sure that we're generating enough revenue to pay back whatever it is the RHID is paying for, to make sure that we're generating enough to pay that back.

Department Head:
Start: 00:45:51.000

--------------------------------------------------
Department Head:
Start: 00:45:56.000

Start: 02:03:30.000

Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: So and the other thing that I think will benefit for that is that that allows us to start getting specific proposals in front of us that are specific pieces of property and specific plans and specific ideas and then we can say, okay, well this we can make those adjustments on case by case basis instead of trying to imagine every single thing that might happen in the future.

Start: 02:03:55.000

Text: And I think we all know that that is a possibility but I don't want to see what I feel like what's happening in Potta Waterming County where Wamego has a proposal they want to do it but nobody will do anything because they're afraid of what the Potta Waterming County Commission might do and probably understandably so but what that has become is effectively a pocket veto of that and I don't want to see that here.
