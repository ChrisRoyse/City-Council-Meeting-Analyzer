Text: It's a destruction of property so it is it is already illegal to do this it's just that it's probably under several different ordinances the penalties for each of those range a little bit based upon the offense for example the theft of property of less than 1500 you can do an up to $500 fine or six months in jail in contrast for the criminal deprivation of property which is you take it but discard it you don't keep it for yourself it has a fine up to $1,000 in a year in jail.

So when these issues come up we get the these contracts come to the legal department and our response is the same every time and this is the main issue the commission has to decide what do you want to do with the city logos and trademarks now and in the future because we're not a city in which this is a novel thing that's come up once and let's just sign it we've had a history of the city commissions and city park forward and other city officials.

End: 02:10:13.500
Duration: 25.000 seconds
Text: From 245 to 5 o'clock or 530. 530. 530. And so this is a time when those rec centers have been inundated and it's going to bring more structure to it. The school district will still be utilizing their gyms for their after school athletic times.

City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 02:10:13.500
End: 02:10:36.500
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: We think it will be a better method. They have currently operations at the middle schools in the class and after school classrooms. So this will be expanding that component and I think the news release does a good job of laying that out for you and I think will be good for it.

City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 02:10:36.500

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 02:10:58.500
End: 02:11:21.500
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So I don't think it's going to be a big interference issue because those folks were not participating in utilizing the facility during those times. So we certainly have the Douglas Community Center where folks could go to do some of those activities if that's a time frame that folks are looking for some of the exercise and capabilities within those facilities.

Start: 02:11:54.500
End: 02:12:11.500
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So remember the again the original goal when we asked the question for the rec centers was that the school district was going to use all of the facility during school hours and for school events and then we would program it in the evenings and on weekends.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 02:12:11.500

Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: It gave basically them two gyms for their use during the school days and after school and gave us rec centers that was one of our big budget hits because we're not operating in a rec center 12 hours a day.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 02:12:27.500
End: 02:12:39.500
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So we don't really the school is still going to use to those gyms so that really only leaves the other two gyms and it's hard to mix those and have a control of that site.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 02:12:39.500
End: 02:12:51.500
Duration: 12.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager Ron Fehr:
Start: 02:12:51.500
End: 02:13:02.500
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:13:02.500
End: 02:13:18.500
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: I looked at that pretty hard last year. I think I brought up the problem where all those people were there because I you know I know a number of the folks that played pickleball in their late and and runs right they they left because it wasn't just 60 kids it was a hundred kids.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:13:18.500
End: 02:13:27.500
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And they did things like grab basketballs and throw them at people that were on the running track and they chased people off the pickleball courts and they were they were out of control.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:13:27.500
End: 02:13:42.500
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: And so I think this is a great solution because we need to put some structure in there and I think you know some of the older folks that were there they didn't want to basically play with the younger kids they were going to leave anyway as Ron says.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:13:42.500
End: 02:13:49.500
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And so the fact that they won't be able to use it from you know three to five thirty I just don't think that's a crisis.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:13:49.500
End: 02:13:57.500

Start: 02:13:57.500

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:14:10.500
End: 02:14:23.500
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And you know I still think this is a better solution because without this control there probably would have been damage to the rex owners and it would cost us money and the pickleball stuff would be damaged and things of that nature.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:14:23.500

Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: I think I've had experience with boys and girls club and I understand what the mayor is saying I think the idea of having community members there was extremely important but the vandalism and everything that occurred and not having enough staff is an issue and I don't think we've resolved that.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:14:52.500
End: 02:15:10.500
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: So I think as a placeholder if we have an organization such as boys and girls club come and utilize that because we also don't have a YMCA or anywhere else for these children students to go and one of the predominant crisis in our community has been there isn't a place for adolescents to hang out.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:15:10.500
End: 02:15:34.500
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: And I think this might provide that extra piece for working parents where instead of going out there and just rummaging through stuff there's some structure to this and boys and girls club has that as their mission and it's probably I think it's worth reviewing looking at it and then if we have enough staff to cover our rex owners next year maybe that's something we need to do.

Commissioner Rob Ott:
Start: 02:15:34.500
