City Manager:
Start: 00:24:43.280

City Manager:
Start: 00:25:34.280

Eric Norris:
Start: 00:26:16.280

--------------------------------------------------
Eric Norris:
Start: 00:26:25.280

Eric Norris:
Start: 00:26:31.280
End: 00:26:43.280
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: I think it was maybe 35 or 40. So I think, I think I am supportive of this project mainly because there are so many things involved in ADA that we don't even see.

Eric Norris:
Start: 00:26:43.280

--------------------------------------------------
Eric Norris:
Start: 00:26:57.280
End: 00:27:11.280
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And it just proves to be, I think it's just good for us to be in compliance with it. If they couldn't get it down below 600,000 or whatever it might be, if they go lower, we're going to be taking out more things that we don't want them to look at.
--------------------------------------------------
Eric Norris:
Start: 00:27:11.280
End: 00:27:21.280
Duration: 10.000 seconds
