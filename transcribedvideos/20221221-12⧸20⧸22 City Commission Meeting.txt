First of all, based on the fact that you're moving 25% of the, your first occupants that are apparently fully committed are going to be relocated, there's no reason we should be at 100% from day 75% is the top as far as I would go based on the fact that

Commissioner Rady:
Start: 01:40:10.520
End: 01:40:19.520

Text: And that's where I was headed, Sarah. I agree with you. The point I'm trying to also distinguish between the majority of the commissioners, do they desire a development agreement that actually holds the foundation accountable when out years to jobs, investment, and those other factors.

Commissioner Rady:
Start: 01:42:47.520
End: 01:43:05.520
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: That's typically how we structure IRBs with abatements. And I made that point earlier. It just clarifies for you all, the community, and the applicant, what the expectations are, the percentage is the number of years, and then gets into that job creation category.

Commissioner Rady:
Start: 01:43:05.520
End: 01:43:22.520
Duration: 17.000 seconds

Commissioner Rady:
Start: 01:43:22.520

City Clerk:
Start: 01:43:34.520
End: 01:43:53.520
Duration: 19.000 seconds

Text: There are your options. I'd like, I think we would like to support this thing five to nothing. We just got to come up with something that we can live with a little bit better. And so I think we've got to feel a general, you kind of have an idea of what we're thinking.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 01:44:10.520
End: 01:44:22.520
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Go back and chat some more and see what we can come up with so we can all get behind it and feel good about it. Because I think right now the public doesn't feel good about it. The ones we hear from, we don't feel good about it.

What should that look like because that should be a template for other organizations that want if there is a property tax abatement that they would like to request.

End: 04:12:38.280
Duration: 29.000 seconds
Text: Right now anything over 20 we're doing competitive bidding and we're asking that that number be raised a little bit just because there are a lot of projects now that I mean inflation and things that we have we have projects that are over that amount and and going through the bidding process sometimes will delay it or create some confusion in the marketplace and so we're just asking for the same consideration that you've given the city staff for that number to go up at least somewhat and I think 50s the number you use for the city but even if it's not the same thing.

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:24:26.780
End: 04:24:38.780

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:24:38.780
End: 04:24:43.780

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:25:01.780
End: 04:25:11.780

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:25:25.780

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:25:33.780
End: 04:25:39.780

Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:25:46.780
End: 04:25:51.780
Duration: 5.000 seconds

Commissioner Rady:
Start: 04:25:51.780
End: 04:25:55.780
Duration: 4.000 seconds

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:25:55.780

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:26:02.780
End: 04:26:17.780
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: Once all that is complete and everyone knows not only the charge of that board, but how that board is going to operate when they annually accept applications for funds and how they would deliberate and recommend those funds.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:26:17.780
End: 04:26:34.780
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: Then we would open up the process at the beginning of June based on that ordinance, you know, those bylaws, any other rules that we've established to accept applications for funding for this board.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:26:34.780
End: 04:26:39.780

Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:26:39.780
End: 04:26:53.780
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Once you close that application period, you'd have, and this, the next timeline here is kind of, I guess you could say, the best case scenario that we talked about where it's pretty straightforward.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:26:53.780
End: 04:27:16.780
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: So it's going to meet over July and mid August to consider the applications, deliberate and recommend a funding approach to you all that then like we would normally in June, we would come back to you all during a budget work session possibly in August with their funding recommendation.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:27:16.780
End: 04:27:21.780
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: And we would work that into the 2024 budget that you all would adopt.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:27:21.780
End: 04:27:37.780
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: Now, if deliberations take longer, if this timeline gets shifted, we did talk about at the December 13th meeting that again, back at, oh no.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:27:37.780
End: 04:27:52.780
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So this February 7th meeting, if we've established a budget amount, we can just possibly plug in the budget amount to the 2024 budget and take a little bit longer into the fall for that group to make a recommendation.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Hassel:
Start: 04:27:52.780
End: 04:28:01.780
Duration: 9.000 seconds

End: 04:28:18.780

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rady:
Start: 04:28:38.780
End: 04:28:49.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And I think when we get through the process of the makeup of the board, I definitely would prefer people that have had experience because this is the first time they're going to be doing a joint funding.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rady:
Start: 04:28:50.780
End: 04:28:58.780
Duration: 8.000 seconds

Commissioner Rady:
Start: 04:29:06.780
End: 04:29:17.780
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: I think even the timeline as far as waiting to September 1st, especially because there will be a dedicated funding amount to work with.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Rady:
Start: 04:29:17.780
End: 04:29:22.780
Duration: 5.000 seconds

City Clerk:
Start: 04:29:22.780
End: 04:29:39.780
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: I think the timeline is important because it accomplishes getting the mechanics of getting a board appointed so that recommendations can be folded into the budget in August.

Start: 04:29:39.780
End: 04:29:49.780

Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: I think according to what I have here one of slides I saved is 633,000 was I think a mill last or for this 2023 so .9% of that is 63,000 less than that 570 something we might find to add a little bit.
