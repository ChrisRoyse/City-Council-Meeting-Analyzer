Text: But that was one of the reasons I haven't advocated for spending reserves just because tomorrow I'll be telling the department heads that sales taxes were down again and they better plan on giving me more money back at the end of the year than what we'd originally had set for targets.

Text: I'm fine with publishing it at whatever number of percentage we choose because I do want to work on bringing it down more mainly because as a growing community we keep saying we're growing we're doing so well we're doing so well everybody should come and spend their money.

Text: But if we're doing so well we shouldn't have to raise the middle of every time and I think that's our property valuations are going up and even if it's just for a third of them that same third is that same third every year because it's not somebody else that's decreasing because my property taxes are going up every single year more than the year before.

Text: And there I've been on the commission when we went flat and I've been on the commission when we went really high on some of those years but as we continue to grow we can't keep raising it and I understand more than anything when I look at our social services budget and the special alcohol funds budget.

Text: They're building more people are buying more houses they're doing more things so even though we have more challenges within our budget I'd rather see us having a flat middle of the knowing that property taxes are still going up for other people they're still going to have an increase in their property taxes.

Text: And school fees are always there there's tuition increases that are going up everywhere soldiers are coming back but then that's one of those up and down trends that you can't see as much as we like it's not as stable but it could be because the soldiers were gone this time that our sales tax revenue has been down if all of them come back maybe it'll go back up again when the students come back it might go back up again.

Text: So my concern is the burden that's falling on our taxpayers every time we say we're growing we're doing really well and at some point they're going to get tired of hearing it if they're constantly have to pay pay pay so I just want us to address that and see if we can see there's other ways to fund what we need to fund and look at this book a little bit closer we have all these tags I'm sure all of us went through some of it pretty closely and see where we can we don't want to micromanage but at the same time we want to see where we can cut back a little bit more.
