Mayor:
Start: 00:31:04.560

Text: Again the thinking with the timeline there is that the area right in front of love the bill starts with the founding of Aggie bill and the timeline works its way up to the present and so as you cross through the threshold underneath the bridge link you step out the Aggie bill and you're at the present time so it's a progression of historic photos as time goes on down there.

Text: So one of our big responsibilities, as I mentioned, is responding to that scale shift. So this is a look at the facade along North Manhattan and the Rally House, of course, as a one or two-story building and we're transitioning to a five-story building.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:20:25.560
End: 01:20:47.560
Duration: 22.000 seconds
Text: We've done this, tried to maintain the line of those two-story buildings with some brick, stone, metal, and glass reminiscent of the scale of the rest of Aggieville and doing something different for those elevations above, those tiers above, something lighter and different so that we're not having a building that's looming over the street.

Mayor:
Start: 01:20:47.560
End: 01:20:58.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: One of the things that was mentioned in Keller's presentation was that bridge connection and you can see it here going between what is the stair tower of the new parking garage and the Rally House.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:20:58.560
End: 01:21:07.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Mayor:
Start: 01:21:14.560
End: 01:21:20.560

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:21:20.560
End: 01:21:29.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: And again, we're maintaining that two-story brick structure. The first floor, of course, has storefronts for the shops or tenants that might be in those spaces.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:21:29.560
End: 01:21:37.560

Start: 01:21:37.560
End: 01:21:53.560
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: What's critical about treating the facades of the parking garages, that there are code requirements that require that we keep a certain amount of the exterior walls on each tier open for light and air in order to handle the vehicle exhaust to can build up and things like that.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:21:53.560
End: 01:22:03.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: As long as we can maintain what is a pretty good percentage of the walls as open for air circulation, we don't have to introduce mechanical means providing fresh air.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:22:03.560
End: 01:22:07.560
Duration: 4.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:22:07.560
End: 01:22:18.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So the kinetic sculpture again has the brick and glass treatments on the first two floors and then we're proposing doing an activated facade on the floors three through five.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:22:18.560
End: 01:22:25.560

Mayor:
Start: 01:22:30.560
End: 01:22:43.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And we found a product and an application that actually uses something that we have as part of our nature here in Kansas that isn't representational and visual or symbolic of any one certain thing, but it's of nature and it's the wind.

Mayor:
Start: 01:22:43.560
End: 01:22:50.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Mayor:
Start: 01:22:50.560
End: 01:23:01.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: It's very simple here. We'll sort of defer to their direction on that. And then the west side is very simple screened piece intended to something in the future, even expand if Burger King ever goes away.

Mayor:
Start: 01:23:01.560
End: 01:23:06.560

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:23:06.560
End: 01:23:13.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Mayor:
Start: 01:23:13.560
End: 01:23:25.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: It's actually moved up of its made up of a series of moving cards. This happens to be stainless steel cards that are mounted in such a way that they can move with the wind.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:23:25.560
End: 01:23:32.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And there's a lot of varieties of different sort of assemblies we can do in this to get more or less movement.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:23:32.560
End: 01:23:41.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: But it not only activates the outside, but from the inside you get various play of light. It's breathable. It's open. It doesn't feel claustrophobic.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:23:41.560
End: 01:23:54.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: It really is sort of a neat application that can speak about, you know, it sort of takes the unknowable and makes it knowable, the unseeable and makes it seeable in the case of the wind.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:23:54.560
End: 01:24:00.560
Duration: 6.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:24:00.560
End: 01:24:12.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And the next slide, this is just a couple of more applications of the same type of system. And again, there's a lot of variety we can do in this with materials, size of the card, the amount of action that they have, colors.

Mayor:
Start: 01:24:12.560
End: 01:24:17.560

Mayor:
Start: 01:24:17.560
End: 01:24:37.560
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: We thought that art might be out of reach for us on this building, but we think with this sort of application we can do it in a fairly economical way and do something that's impactful and unique for our district.

Mayor:
Start: 01:24:42.560
End: 01:24:55.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Again, you can see that even when the cards are still, you get a sense of light and vision through them to what's going on outside and then the vision on the picture on the right is just another application on a parking garage.

Mayor:
Start: 01:24:55.560

End: 01:25:53.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Right now we're showing the rest of the building beyond that point, sort of being what it is a parking garage up there with some occasional spots of screening or more of those garage levels are visible, such as over the entrance to the west.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:25:54.560

Mayor:
Start: 01:25:55.560
End: 01:26:06.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: Option two is one that's got a less than elegant name. It's called bar grading, but that's because what that's what the product is that we're proposing using as a screening element again up there above that floor.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:26:06.560
End: 01:26:11.560

Start: 01:26:16.560
End: 01:26:27.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Mayor:
Start: 01:26:39.560
End: 01:26:46.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: And one of the intriguing things about this material is it can change its amounts of transparency, depending on the angle that you're viewing it.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:26:46.560
End: 01:26:53.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: In the lower left corner that view you can see that when you're looking at it straight on, it's fairly transparent. You can see what's going on inside.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:26:53.560
End: 01:27:03.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: If you approach it from an angle, it becomes more opaque. And so the building can have sort of a shifting aspect as you move around it and the sun changes on throughout the day.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:27:03.560
End: 01:27:10.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Again, this is a view of the building rendered with that product on those upper levels. And you can see you can get a hint of what's going on behind it with the parking levels.

Mayor:
Start: 01:27:10.560
End: 01:27:22.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: But it's not shouting at you that it's a parking garage. And then the next image again is that is if you're on the moral and larmy or sorry the North Manhattan and Laramie intersection.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:27:22.560
End: 01:27:25.560

End: 01:27:32.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: The third option we're calling perforated panels. And it's pretty much what they are. These are metal panels that are applied to the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:27:32.560
End: 01:27:41.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: In most cases, the panels are corrugated or rippled and they're punched with tiny holes. This is the parking garage at the garment headquarters in Olayfa.

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:27:49.560
End: 01:28:02.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The next slide shows you sort of the simple way that it's applied. It's simply corrugated metal punched with holes and it's hung on an armature of metal tubes to the and applied to the outside of the building.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:28:02.560
End: 01:28:11.560
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: It's pretty straightforward. But it does a pretty nice job of masking and screening parts of the building as you want to. It can be very controlled.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:28:11.560
End: 01:28:16.560
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: There are a lot of different kinds of perforated panels we can look at that would give us the airflow and the light we need.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:28:16.560
End: 01:28:29.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The next example is probably more expensive example, but it's a different sort of folded plate. So you can get a lot of different sort of shimmering light effects, depending on how you treat the facets of those metal pieces.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:28:29.560
End: 01:28:48.560
Duration: 19.000 seconds
Text: The next image is one where metal panels have actually been treated with a photographic image. And this can be achieved in a couple of ways. It can be either photo screened onto the perforated panels or in this case they actually use very precisely controlled spacing and size of the holes to produce the image on those screens.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:28:48.560
End: 01:29:00.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: It is interesting to note that when you do a screen this way, the metal panels either have to be quite a bit heavier in gauge or they have quite a bit more support to keep those panels from buckling and rippling under the wind loads.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:29:00.560
End: 01:29:07.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Because the corrugations naturally stiffen the panels whereas a flat panel like this needs a little more structure behind.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:29:08.560
End: 01:29:23.560
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: The next image is again another look at perforated panels. This one uses custom made panels that have larger holes in them and actually space these out so as one is standing inside the building, you don't have panels blocking your view but there are panels above and below.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:29:23.560
End: 01:29:28.560
Duration: 5.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:29:29.560
End: 01:29:39.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And then finally this is another example where the corrugations are turned on their side and run the other direction and it's done in a colored metal instead of just the silver or galvanized finish.

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:29:48.560
End: 01:30:02.560
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: So this is the image with the perforated panels on it and this degree of transparency is representative of what we would see based on how much of those panels we would have to have open for air circulation and you can see the amount of visibility that can come through that.

Mayor:
Start: 01:30:14.560
End: 01:30:32.560
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: And then the fourth option we've given you is the one that really looks towards simply being as most economical as possible and that would be if we just treat the first two floors of the parking garage as we have previously and then just let the upper tiers be what they are and that is a pre-cast concrete parking garage.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:30:32.560
End: 01:30:42.560
Duration: 10.000 seconds

Mayor:
Start: 01:30:42.560
End: 01:30:52.560

City Manager:
Start: 01:48:21.560
End: 01:48:36.560
Duration: 15.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:49:33.560
End: 01:49:40.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:49:40.560
End: 01:49:46.560

--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:49:46.560
End: 01:50:06.560
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: I do want to point out on this particular slide that this would include onboarding key contractors in an early GMP process, specifically, like a precast and the structural contractors that would have significantly long lead times to generate materials.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:50:06.560
End: 01:50:17.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So what this would mean is this would require a while we consider a rolling GMP or a phase GMP process where we would be in front of the commission.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:50:17.560
End: 01:50:28.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So we would expect several times with a GIT guarantee maximum price for a specific scope of work and then a budget for the remaining design yet to be complete.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:50:28.560
End: 01:50:36.560
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And we would expect at this point to to GMP presentations to get the construction started.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:50:36.560
End: 01:50:48.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: But as I did note, this would include a construction start date kind of late this year, assuming that all chips fall in the right spot.

Mayor:
Start: 01:50:48.560
End: 01:50:59.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Start: 01:50:59.560
End: 01:51:24.560

Mayor:
Start: 01:51:24.560
End: 01:51:31.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds

End: 01:51:43.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds

End: 01:51:52.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds

City Manager:
Start: 01:51:52.560
End: 01:52:05.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Kind of has less of this, but what I would reiterate on Barry's comments, the site itself, obviously, is the parking lot.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:52:05.560
End: 01:52:13.560
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And that first phase, I believe, Barry incorrect me, but that first phase GMP would be basically doing all the site work.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:52:13.560
End: 01:52:20.560
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So we're going to do a little bit more removal of the parking lot and then getting the stabilization for the garage completed.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:52:20.560
End: 01:52:28.560
Duration: 8.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:52:28.560
End: 01:52:34.560
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: We would do another GMP before that precast starts to arrive. That kind of a split, Barry.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:52:34.560
End: 01:52:46.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Yeah, that's correct. So the precast is the long lead time items. In other words, it takes upwards of six months to get that design and fabricated and delivered ultimately to the site.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:52:46.560
End: 01:52:51.560
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: Kind of in the first quarter, late in the first quarter of 2021.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:52:51.560
End: 01:53:06.560
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So what we would propose or what this this schedule would propose here is that we would actually onboard that precast contractor as well as the underground or the structural subcontractors.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:53:06.560
End: 01:53:21.560
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: In other words, the all the supporting structure that would hold up the precast structure to get that underway in a timely fashion so that the site could really be ready for that precast when it arrives.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:53:21.560
End: 01:53:34.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: And that's going to be critical to meet this schedule so that we're not incurring additional winter conditions or fighting through winter weather to get the structure in place.
--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:53:34.560
End: 01:53:54.560
Duration: 20.000 seconds
Text: Okay, so just for the folks that are watching because it doesn't look quite right. The precast structure procurement, you're saying probably around August through January of 2021 and construction should start probably about November or December.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:53:54.560
End: 01:54:08.560
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. So this this would actually the process would actually start in August, kind of late August early September is when we would go hit the market for this structural package.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 01:54:08.560
End: 01:54:31.560
Duration: 23.000 seconds
Text: And then there would not be really any activity. It would all be kind of preemptive behind the scenes work that would take place and we would take we would actually arrive on site, mobile eyes with construction traffic and then in the in the November timeline late October early November.

City Manager:
Start: 01:54:31.560
End: 01:54:45.560

Start: 01:54:45.560
End: 01:54:56.560
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:54:56.560
End: 01:55:10.560
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: The reason we believe that's critical is twofold. One, as Mary mentioned, the weather, and if we can get started before the weather hits it gave a gain two, three months out of this deal, maybe even four.
--------------------------------------------------
City Manager:
Start: 01:55:10.560
End: 01:55:23.560
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: The other side of it is again, I've heard from multiple development opportunities that are waiting for that GMP to be approved, which basically moves this project forward.

City Manager:
Start: 01:55:23.560

--------------------------------------------------
Mayor:
Start: 01:56:48.560
End: 01:56:58.560

Duration: 28.000 seconds
Text: I want to take a moment and talk about a couple things. I know that in other jurisdictions, there have been legal challenges to the face covering requirements. And in the state of Kansas and in the 10th Circuit Federal Courts, which is the Federal Circuit we're in, there is not a guiding case law at the moment that would help us draft an ordinance that might pass a legal challenge.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 02:33:14.560
End: 02:33:32.560
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: I wanted to note that there are cases that are similar. There's about 15 to 20 states and numerous cities that have actually adopted the opposite. They adopt an ordinance that prohibits you from wearing a mask and public in certain circumstances. They're very limited in application.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 02:33:32.560
End: 02:33:56.560
Duration: 24.000 seconds
Text: And those have been litigated and challenged around the United States. I bring those up only because the outcome of those that line of cases, it's split in some cases, those ordinances or those state laws have been upheld because they were narrowly crafted to meet the government's need or their purpose. And in some cases, they were struck down because they were too broad.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 02:33:56.560
End: 02:34:23.560
Duration: 27.000 seconds
Text: I bring that up because that while we don't have guidance in Kansas specifically about how to write a city ordinance that could survive a legal challenge, we know that our general, we know that generally we have to comply with the rule that since the constitutional rights are impacted that we have to narrowly tailor the law so that as narrowly as possible to meet our purpose.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 02:34:23.560
End: 02:34:35.560
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So it has to be, it can't be over broad, it can't be vague and it needs to be very carefully crafted because there are constitutional implications of this type of ordinance.
--------------------------------------------------
Commissioner Morris:
Start: 02:34:35.560
End: 02:34:52.560
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So my take away on that, my summary of that is while the city does have the legal authority to adopt an ordinance of this type, that legal authority is not unlimited. We would have to be very cautious about the way that we draft the ordinance, how it applies, who it applies to in order for it to have a better success if it is challenged.

Text: now and then how to fix your child seat car seat or how do you you know about these smoke detectors so if we have those types of snippets those are things the city can do the packets of hand sanitizers I think that's a fabulous idea for one in your purse when you go out you can wipe your hands real quick and move on.

Text: I do still do think face coverings do have a purpose and even though we haven't found a great way to push those forward I do think having a wild cat face covering that's going to come out of Kansas State University and now they have all kinds of designer ones make it a little bit more oriented to our demographic and our community even with that one says I love MHK or something I don't know but things that make it

Text: okay to wear and take out the politics out of it because it has been proven over and over again that the mask we are wearing is to protect others if I wear a mask it's not doing me any good it's helping my spit not going to other people and ask for this of it and I think this is one of the best discussions we've had one because we all disagreed and two came to some kind of a consensus

Text: so that's that's the best part that could happen and I'm sure is it possible given our ordinance not our or cool our resolution sorry you got me confused now our resolution with the city manager going till June 30th now Ron has some authority to do some things that perhaps we would we wouldn't need to wait two weeks to be and so you know move forward with those

Text: types of things with the PSA any kind of expenditures that it might and smaller dollar amounts to get that message out the sooner the better there's there's clearly people that come to mind that aren't as polarizing as any of us in this community that people that have their name on stadiums and on highways that could potentially market to a certain demographic that is very important to us

Text: It puts businesses in a safer place that we are all working on this together to get the message out that's coming from all of these other federal state and local agencies and that's where we need to be and that that was the purpose of tonight's discussion it kind of went on a detour here and everywhere but I think we ended up in a safe spot so with that I have nothing more to add.
