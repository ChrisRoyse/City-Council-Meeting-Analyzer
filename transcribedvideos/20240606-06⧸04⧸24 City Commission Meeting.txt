Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:05.920
End: 00:50:11.920
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: By going through this, I want to touch on a couple of major items that are shown up there.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:11.920
End: 00:50:14.920
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: The first is why finance at all?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:14.920
End: 00:50:21.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: What is the purpose of issuing debt to pay for different types of projects? What is the theory behind that?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:21.920
End: 00:50:39.920
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: I'd also like to talk a little bit about the different types of financing that the city of Manhattan can do, both in a traditional governmental process, as well as some of the more unique or exotic tools that may be out there that you have used in the past or maybe able to use in the future.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:39.920
End: 00:50:43.920
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: The third item is state law limitations and authorizations.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:43.920
End: 00:50:52.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So as you know, you're a governmental entity that is subject to various state laws that are passed by the Kansas legislature.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:50:52.920
End: 00:51:00.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so I'm going to touch on some of those as they apply to the city when you're doing different types of projects and different types of finance.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:00.920
End: 00:51:18.920
Duration: 18.000 seconds
Text: Last but not least, I want to just briefly walk through the process itself from the authorization to the actual sale and issuance of that debt to the final point where you actually get the money in the bank so then you can actually use it for those projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:18.920
End: 00:51:21.920
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: So to start off with, like I said, why finance at all?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:21.920
End: 00:51:36.920
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: You know, we're all individuals and when we have projects, we either save up the money and we pay for those or if it's a large scale project, we go to the bank and we get a commercial loan if we're a business or we get a personal loan if we're building a house.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:36.920
End: 00:51:40.920
Duration: 4.000 seconds
Text: Why are cities different? Why can't the city just go out and do that?
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:40.920
End: 00:51:46.920
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Actually, it relates about 90 years ago back during the Great Depression in the 1930s.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:51:46.920
End: 00:52:01.920
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: There were a lot of concerns that cities and Kansas made up going bankrupt because there were a lot of debts and contractual obligations that they had taken on that nobody really knew about.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:01.920
End: 00:52:11.920
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: They may just go down to the bank and they get that friendly banker to give them a loan and nobody really understands repayment terms or anything about that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:11.920
End: 00:52:17.920
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: And so there was a lot of concern during that Great Depression that there was going to be large scale municipal bankrupt sales.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:17.920
End: 00:52:22.920
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: So the Kansas legislature back in the 30s passed what's called the cash basis law.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:22.920
End: 00:52:43.920
Duration: 21.000 seconds
Text: And in essence, what this law says is that if you are a political subdivision that funds your operations from property taxes, then you cannot enter into a contract to make a payment unless you have that same amount of money on hand and you have the budget authority to make that payment.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:43.920
End: 00:52:58.920
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: So if you enter into a contract for a million dollar project, then cash basis says you have to have a million dollars available so that if you had to pay for that entire contract on that day, you'd be able to do that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:52:58.920
End: 00:53:01.920
Duration: 3.000 seconds
Text: That's the cash basis law in a nutshell.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:01.920
End: 00:53:17.920
Duration: 16.000 seconds
Text: So that is very constricting. And like I said, that applies to any government that gets property taxes so that cities, county school districts, townships, drainage districts, everything across the board, very constrictive.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:17.920
End: 00:53:28.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so there are ways that were built into that exceptions to the rule to allow cities to still be able to go out there and finance those projects that they need.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:28.920
End: 00:53:40.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And in many main ways that cities, county school districts are able to get that exception to the cash basis law is through the authorization and issuance of bonds to pay for those projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:40.920
End: 00:53:48.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So once again, in my example, if you have that million dollar project and you sign that contract, you have to have a million dollars available.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:48.920
End: 00:53:58.920
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: And if you don't, if you go through the process instead to authorize bonds to finance that million dollar project, even though you don't have the money in the bank, you're okay.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:53:58.920
End: 00:54:03.920
Duration: 5.000 seconds
Text: That's not a cash basis violation. You're complying with the cash basis law by doing that.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:03.920
End: 00:54:17.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: And so that fundamentally is the reason why cities, counties, and school districts finance their large scale capital projects because they want to comply with requirements of the cash basis law.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:18.920
End: 00:54:25.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: So when we talk about those bonds and those projects and how we get there, there's basically four main steps.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:25.920
End: 00:54:32.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Show them up there. Project authorization comes first. So once again, that is that bond authority to give you the exception to the cash basis law.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:32.920
End: 00:54:39.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Kansas statutes have a variety of different ways to finance a variety of different projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:39.920
End: 00:54:56.920
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: So if the city has a sewer project that it needs to authorize for bonds, there's a handful of statutes that my firm working with city administration will look through to figure out which of those laws applies to that specific project.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:54:56.920
End: 00:55:08.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And their statutes for sewer projects, street projects, water projects, park projects, public building projects, anything, anything of a capital nature that you can think of.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:08.920
End: 00:55:15.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: There's a state law on it and the state law says, you're as held the city authorizes this specific type of project.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:15.920
End: 00:55:27.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So that's a lot of what we do on the front end working with the city is determining what kind of projects you have and how do you get those authorized that authorization might take the form of city commission to adopt the resolution.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:27.920
End: 00:55:35.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Pretty cut and dry, simple majority. It might take the form of you have to provide notice and protest for a certain type of project.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:35.920
End: 00:55:44.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So you might adopt that resolution. You have to publish it once a week for two weeks in the city newspaper and then there's a 30 day protest period.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:44.920
End: 00:55:55.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: The type of the project may require a successful election before you actually have the authority to sign that contract and to issue the bonds to pay that cost.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:55:55.920
End: 00:56:06.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: And so that's the first step and it's a very important step because like I said, it's all driven by the state law requirements and making sure that we have the proper authority to issue those bonds.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:06.920
End: 00:56:12.920
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: Once you've been through that process, then we get into the actual marketing and sale of the bonds.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:12.920
End: 00:56:27.920
Duration: 15.000 seconds
Text: We're not actually selling them yet, but in essence what we're doing is we're pulling together a lot of the information about the city and we're using that working with Tom Calico and his folks over Baker Tilly to help get information about the city out into the municipal marketplace.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:27.920
End: 00:56:34.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: Most of your bonds are actually sold at what's called a public sale. So it's like an auction.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:34.920
End: 00:56:43.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So in essence, the city would provide notices as at 11 o'clock on Tuesday, we're going to take bids and we're going to sell these amount of bonds for these projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:43.920
End: 00:56:51.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: Banks, if you want to buy these bonds, submit your interest rates as to what you would like to see on these.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:56:51.920
End: 00:57:03.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: And then at 11 o'clock, the window for the bids closes, those bids are evaluated in the lowest interest rate, the lowest interest cost to the city is usually how it's determined for the best bid.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:03.920
End: 00:57:20.920
Duration: 17.000 seconds
Text: That's in order to get that word out about the sale though, there are various documents that are put together, various notices that are provided to those investment banks to drum up the business because the more bid you get, most likely, the better the result is going to be for the city.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:20.920
End: 00:57:31.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So that's the marketing and the actual sale of those bonds. Once the sale is occurred, final interest rates are determined, the purchaser is determined, the final principal repayments are determined.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:31.920
End: 00:57:38.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds
Text: The city approves the bond resolution and they approve the temporary no resolution. And then we have to get various state level approvals.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:38.920
End: 00:57:50.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Every bond in the state of Kansas has to be approved by the Attorney General's Office. Every bond that is issued, it has to be registered in the office of the state treasure.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:50.920
End: 00:57:59.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So that's a lot of what my firm does after the sale. We're working with the city staff, we're making sure we have all those documents that are prepared for us and sends over to us.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:57:59.920
End: 00:58:08.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: We run those through the various state agencies to make sure that the city has all of its necessary approvals to actually issue the bonds.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:58:08.920
End: 00:58:22.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: That's the final step. Issue once is also called closing. That's when the deal actually closes. So a closing is when the bond is turned over to the possession of that winning bidder, that investment bank with the best interest rates.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:58:22.920
End: 00:58:28.920
Duration: 6.000 seconds
Text: That's when they actually take possession of the bond and exchange that pay the purchase price to the city.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:58:28.920
End: 00:58:37.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds
Text: So it's at closing that you actually get the money from the bond sale that you can then immediately start using to pay for your project costs.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:58:37.920
End: 00:58:48.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: So for instance, city had a temporary note sale and a bond sale a couple of weeks ago. We're coming up on June 14th. That is the closing of the bonds and the closing of the temporary notes.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:58:48.920
End: 00:59:00.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: So on June 14th, that is the actual day that the note in the bond are going to get turned over to the possession of the purchaser and the purchaser is going to wire that money into the city's bank account.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:59:00.920
End: 00:59:14.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: That's actually what happens at closing. Those are the four main steps that lead from the beginning of determining which projects and how you need to get them authorized all the way to when you get the money in the bank to actually pay for those projects.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:59:14.920
End: 00:59:27.920
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: As I say up there, it could be a lengthy process. If you have to have an election for those projects, it's always best to plan ahead because elections are hard to pull together. They take time, they take money, they take effort.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:59:27.920
End: 00:59:40.920
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: So just kind of things to keep in mind. It's not necessarily a quick process. We've been through it enough times. We kind of know the road, but still it takes a lot of work and it takes a lot of time.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:59:40.920
End: 00:59:48.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And it's a different type of bonds that a city may issue. So these are kind of the traditional obligations. These are what the city issues a lot of.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 00:59:48.920
End: 01:00:09.920

Text: So we have general obligation bonds, which are the long term debt instrument that the city uses. You issue geo bonds to pay for your capital projects, you make city of large projects that you're working on, whether it's Aggieville garage or some of the pool projects, some of the park projects, most of your street projects, those are all general obligation bonds.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:00:27.920
End: 01:00:39.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: Once you've completed your home, you do the long term, you know, 30 year mortgage to take out your construction financing, similar process to temporary notes and geo bonds.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:00:39.920
End: 01:00:50.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds
Text: The temporary notes are used to provide that construction financing for the projects themselves. They can only go out for up to four years. So they provide the money to get the project built.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:00:50.920
End: 01:00:59.920
Duration: 9.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:00:59.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:01:31.920
End: 01:01:44.920
Duration: 13.000 seconds

End: 01:02:33.920

Start: 01:02:33.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:03:12.920

Start: 01:03:22.920
End: 01:03:34.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds
Text: The city does not. By issuing these bonds, the city does get various benefits. There may be a sales tax exemption that they're able to use in order to keep their project costs down.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:03:34.920
End: 01:03:48.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: Basically anything that they buy that would be subject to sales tax. If they have an industrial revenue bond that's going to finance that purchase, then they can get an exemption and they would not have to pay sales tax on those purchases.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:03:48.920
End: 01:04:00.920
Duration: 12.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:04:00.920
End: 01:04:14.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds
Text: I say up to on both of those because it's a negotiation between the city and the company as to what level of abatement you may be willing to provide for that project and for that company.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:04:14.920
End: 01:04:24.920
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: A lot of times it may also be spelled out in your policy. Kind of how you want to look at that. Ultimately, though, like I said, those industrial revenue bonds, they are not an obligation to the city.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:04:24.920
End: 01:04:32.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: So if for some reason that the company does not repay that bond, that's the company's fault.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:04:32.920
End: 01:04:42.920
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: The city has no more obligation to repay that bond. Frankly, the city is prohibited under state law from using public funds to repay that bond.

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:04:42.920
End: 01:04:52.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:05:49.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:05:59.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:06:44.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:07:22.920
End: 01:07:25.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:07:25.920
End: 01:07:33.920
Duration: 8.000 seconds
Text: And so the property taxes that are levied on that base value. From the city, the county, the school district, you know, various other entities.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:07:33.920
End: 01:07:39.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:07:39.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:07:45.920
End: 01:07:55.920
Duration: 10.000 seconds
Text: So as that property is improved and it develops and the value goes up, it's the same mill levied being levied on that property.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:07:55.920
End: 01:08:02.920
Duration: 7.000 seconds

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:08:02.920

Commissioner McCullough:
Start: 01:08:08.920
End: 01:08:22.920
Duration: 14.000 seconds

Commissioner McCullough:
Start: 01:08:30.920
End: 01:08:41.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds

Commissioner McCullough:
Start: 01:08:41.920

Start: 01:08:47.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:08:51.920
End: 01:09:02.920
Duration: 11.000 seconds

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:09:02.920
End: 01:09:08.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:09:08.920
End: 01:09:16.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:09:16.920
End: 01:09:21.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:09:28.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:09:36.920
End: 01:09:43.920

Start: 01:09:52.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:10:03.920
End: 01:10:12.920

Text: And so if one entity increases their mill levies a lot, well then that means that there's going to be more property tax revenue that's collected off of that increased value.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:10:12.920
End: 01:10:16.920

--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:10:16.920
End: 01:10:29.920
Duration: 13.000 seconds
Text: Now, they're side of the coin. If somebody drops their mill levies a lot, well that's going to decrease the amount of the property tax revenue collected on that incremental amount, which then would decrease the amount of the TIFF revenue eligible for the project.
--------------------------------------------------
Speaker_2:
Start: 01:10:29.920

Speaker_2:
Start: 01:18:16.920
